Lack of association between dietary fructose and
hyperuricemia risk in adults
Sam Z Sun*, Brent D Flickinger, Patricia S Williamson-Hughes, Mark W Empie

Abstract
Background: High serum uric acid concentration (hyperuricemia) has been studied for its relationship with
multiple adverse health outcomes, such as metabolic syndrome. Intervention studies have produced inconsistent
outcomes for the relationship between fructose intake and serum uric acid concentration.
Methods: The association of dietary fructose intake with hyperuricemia risk in adults was examined using logistic
regression and U.S. NHANES 1999-2004 databases. A total of 9,384 subjects, between the ages 20 and 80 years,
without diabetes, cancer, or heart disease, were included.
Results: The highest added or total fructose intake (quartiles by grams or % energy) was not associated with an
increase of hyperuricemia risk compared to the lowest intake with or without adjustment (odds ratios = 0.5150.992). The associations of alcohol and fiber intakes with the risk were also determined. Compared to the lowest
intake, the highest alcohol intake was associated with increased mean serum uric acid concentration (up to 16%, P
< 0.001) and hyperuricemia risk (odds ratios = 1.658-1.829, P = 0.057- < 0.001); the highest fiber intake was
correlated with decreases of uric acid concentration (up to 7.5%, P < 0.002) and lower risk (odds ratios = 0.4480.478, P = 0.001- < 0.001). Adults who were over 50 y old, male, or obese had significantly greater risk.
Conclusions: The data show that increased dietary fructose intake was not associated with increased
hyperuricemia risk; while increased dietary alcohol intake was significantly associated with increased hyperuricemia
risk; and increased fiber intake was significantly associated with decreased hyperuricemia risk. These data further
suggest a potential effect of fructose consumption in an ordinary diet on serum uric acid differs from results found
in some short-term studies using atypical exposure and/or levels of fructose administration.

Introduction
Uric acid or urate is a metabolite of purine or purinecontaining compounds and is considered to be one of
the major endogenous antioxidants. In humans, urate is
excreted as an end product while in other species it is
further metabolized to allantoin. Recent studies have
indicated that high serum uric acid concentration may
be an etiological factor for diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease [1-8]. In addition to
intake of purine-rich foods, such as certain kinds of
meat or seafood, fructose or fructose-containing foods
have been linked to increases in serum uric acid concentration as a result of excessive fructose phosphorylation and rapid expenditure of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) over-yielding purines. A controversial hypothesis

has been recently suggested by Johnson et al [9], purporting that high fructose intake may increase serum
uric acid concentration, leading to the development of
diabetes. Early intervention studies conducted by Macdonald [10], Emmerson [11], and Fox [12] noted that
fructose given experimentally by ingestion or infusion
could induce acute increases of serum uric acid concentrations. However, other studies reported by Crapo [13],
Huttunen [14], Turner [15], Curreri [16], Osei [17,18],
Anderson [19], Koh [20], and Grigoresco [21] did not
observe that fructose influenced serum uric acid concentrations. Narins [22] et al. reported a mixed effect of
fructose on serum uric acid concentration.
The generalization of an outcome from an experimental nutrition trial to an individual’s ordinary food consumption is complicated. The interpretation of a slight,
though statistically significant, change in a biochemical
measurement, such as serum uric acid, into clinical

relevance can be difficult especially when the change is
within a normal clinical range. Very recently, a review
by Livesey [23] indicated that: “Intervention studies in
humans often use fructose at doses that are excessive
compared with amounts generally eaten by adults; such
are not interpretable for purposes of public health policy
in adult population.”
In view of limitations and inconsistent outcomes of
fructose-urate connection from intervention studies, we
examined the relationship between dietary fructose
intakes and risk of hyperuricemia occurrence in the U.S.
adult population with the added assessments of alcohol
and fiber intakes. Alcohol is a known factor to raise uric
acid levels, and fruits and vegetables (which contain significant levels of fiber) are associated with decreasing
uric acid levels [24]. Therefore, alcohol and fiber intakes
were examined as indicators of model appropriateness.
It is expected that this work, utilizing a large population-based approach and data obtained under real-life
setting, can provide more understanding of the potential
association between dietary fructose and uric acid concentration under typical living conditions.

Methods
Data and subjects

Data of dietary intakes, demographics, health status, and
blood chemistries were extracted from databases of the
U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC), National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 19992000, NHANES 2001-02, and NHANES 2003-04 (publically available from http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.
htm). NHANES is a program of studies designed to
assess the health and nutritional status of adults and
children in the United States. The study protocol of
NHANES was approved by Research Ethics Review
Board of CDC National Center for Health Statistics, and
documented consent was obtained from participants.
Adults (N = 9,384) aged 20-80 y, without diabetes, cancer, and/or heart disease were included in this analysis.
Young people were excluded because they are not permitted by law to consume alcohol in the U.S. Among
the dietary intake variables assessed (energy, protein,
total fat, fructose, alcohol, fiber, vitamin C, and caffeine),
the intakes of fructose, alcohol, and fiber were specifically emphasized in this work. For the dietary intake
data, values that did not meet the criteria of reliable
recall status were not used. Demographic factors used in
the analysis included gender, age, race, body weight status, and education level.
Term definition and subject categorization

The key outcome variable assessed in this work was the
risk of hyperuricemia. Based on CDC’s definition in
NHANES 2001-08, the normal medical reference values

Page 2 of 12

of serum uric acid are 3.6-8.4 mg/dL for men and 2.97.5 mg/dL for women (214-500 and 172-449 μmol/L, 1
mg/dL = 59.48 μmol/L), respectively [25]. Thus, we
defined a man as hyperuricemic if his uric acid concentration is > 8.4 mg/dL, and a woman as hyperuricemic if
her uric acid concentration is > 7.5 mg/dL. Some previous studies have defined hyperuricemia as serum uric
acid concentration > 7 mg/dL for men and > 6 mg/dL
for women. However, we chose to utilize the relevant
CDC’s reference in this work because it is a nationally
recognized source. Dietary intake variables, which may
potentially influence the study outcome, included energy
(kcal, 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ), protein, total fat (% of daily
energy), fiber (grams/1000 kcal), vitamin C, caffeine,
added unbound fructose (mono-saccharide fructose), all
added fructose (unbound + bound), and total fructose
(added and naturally-occurring unbound fructose).
These variables were assigned as quartile intakes (1 to
4) based on their 25 th -50 th -75 th percentile values.
Because about 3/4 of the population studied were not
alcohol users on survey days, alcohol consumption levels
were assigned from level 1 to 4 as 0, > 0-15, > 15-30, or
> 30 grams/d (0, > 0-1, > 1-2, and > 2 servings/d). For
demographic variables, age groups were assigned as 2030, 31-40, 41-50, or > 50 y of age (group 1 to 4); body
weight status was categorized from 1 to 3 as normal
(BMI < 25), over weight (25≤BMI < 30), or obese (BMI
≥ 30); race consisted of non-Hispanic White (n = 4533),
Black (African American, n = 1810), Hispanic (2766), or
Other (275) assigned as race 1 to 4; and education levels
were classified as lower than high school, high school
diploma, or higher than high school (level 1 to 3).
Estimation of dietary fructose intake

Because of the wide distribution of fructose in foods and
limitations in the available data describing its content in
the majority of food items, it has been difficult to accurately calculate fructose intake for an individual. The
fructose content in food items was not reported in the
NHANES 1999-2004 food intake data. Years ago, Glinsmann and colleagues [26] created a specific sugar intake
estimation system in which fructose was included. In
this system, conversion factors were assigned for food
groups based on data of added sugar disappearance and
naturally-occurring sugar contents in the defined food
groups. Therefore, fructose intakes could be estimated
using these conversion factors and other relevant data.
This method was reliable for estimating typical fructose
intake in a given population (intake mean); however,
this method would be less reliable to obtain data for an
individual’s fructose intake because of the enormous
variation in fructose contents within a defined food
group, such as fruits or fruit products. Thus, using this
method to quantify the dietary fructose intake and its

Sun et al. Nutrition & Metabolism 2010, 7:16
http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/16

link to a health or biological outcome has limitations.
For the current work, we developed a method to calculate individual fructose intakes relatively accurately
(briefly summarized in the Figure 1).
In our method, the Food Commodity Intake Databases
(FCID), released by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) in 2000 [27] and the USDA National
Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR20), published on the website of USDA Agricultural Research
Service (ARS) [28] were used to document the fructose
contents for fructose-containing food commodities. In
total, fructose content data of 119 from 548

commodities were obtained. If the nutrient database
SR20 did not have a fructose value for a fructose-containing commodity but had the data of its family member, a ratio of the fructose to carbohydrates was used to
calculate the fructose content of the commodity. For
example, SR20 has the fructose content value for
oranges, but not for orange juice, thus, the ratio of fructose to total carbohydrates of orange was used to indirectly calculate the fructose content value of orange
juice. Accordingly, naturally-occurring unbound fructose
intake of each individual can be calculated using the
NHANES food intake databases, Food Commodity

Sun et al. Nutrition & Metabolism 2010, 7:16
http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/16

Composition Database, and the obtained commodity
fructose content data.
With the developed method, an estimation of fructose
intake from added sugars was performed using the following steps. First, added sugars were defined as dietary
sugar/molasses from beet or cane, corn sweeteners
(including high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)-55, HFCS42, and corn syrup), honey, maple sugar/syrup, and sorghum syrup. These added sugars can be identified in
food items using the EPA food commodity composition
database. Because there are only two commodity names
given to corn sweeteners (corn syrup and corn syrup for
baby food), the portion of free fructose in corn sweeteners was calculated based on the ratio of HFCS-55/
HFCS-42/corn-syrup of USDA 1999-2004 corn sweetener disappearance data [29]. The other unbound fructose contents in molasses/syrup/honey can be obtained
from the nutrient database SR20. The bound fructose
was defined as 50% of the sucrose from added sugars.
Additionally, the intakes of added fructose and total
fructose for individuals were calculated using the data
sets as mentioned above. The reliability of this calculation method was validated by comparing the calculated
fructose intake data with existing fructose intake data
using the NHANES-3 and NHANES 1999-2004 database
(detailed in discussion).
Statistical analysis

SAS software (version 9.1, SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) was
utilized as the statistical evaluation tool. P value < 0.05
was considered as significant for statistical comparison.
NHANES 2003-04 has two-day dietary data, however,
NHANES 1999-2000 and 2001-02 have only one-day
dietary data. In order to maintain consistency of data,
we only used day-one data of NHANES 2003-04. After
merging the three databases, descriptive statistics were
performed with adjustment for population weight of
sample size. Serum uric acid concentrations, by fructose
and fiber intake quartiles, and alcohol intake levels were
compared using a general linear model (GLM, with or
without adjustment) with the data of the lowest intake
group as reference (Dunnett control).
A logistic regression (logit) procedure was used in the
risk analysis to examine potential associations of dietary
fructose (added and total), alcohol, and fiber on hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia status (yes or no) was assigned
as the dependent (explained/predicted) variable of the
logit models. Independent (explanatory) variables in the
adjusted model included gender, age group, race, education levels, body weight status (normal, overweight or
obese), dietary intake quartiles of fructose (by gram or
percent of calories), energy (kcal/kJ), protein, total fat,
vitamin C, fiber (grams/1000 kcal), caffeine, and alcohol
intake level. The lower or lowest intake quartile, level,

Page 4 of 12

or category was used as reference group to obtain odds
ratios for the risk of hyperuricemia. The outcomes of
risk analysis (odds ratios) of fructose and fiber intake
quartiles and alcohol intake level were reported because
they are the focus of this work, rather than the adjusting
factors. Goodness-of-fit tests were performed to recognize if the dependent variable could be satisfactorily
explained by the independent variables in the models.
High alcohol intake is a known factor of elevating
serum uric acid concentration; beyond using it as an
adjustment factor, it can also be considered as an indicator of model validation. The statistical power for testing the influence of total fructose and fiber intake on
hyperuricemia risk is 87% using 2.5% as reference of
hyperuricemia prevalence (actual rate was 2.57%), odds
ratio changing 1/2 between intake groups, and significant threshold (a) at 0.05; the power for alcohol intake
is 82% using the same baseline and odds ratio increasing
2/3 between groups.

Results
Subject characteristics and dietary intakes

From the databases of NHANES 1999-2004, 9,384 subjects (4,385 men and 4,999 women), between the ages of
20-80 years, without diabetes, cancer, and/or heart diseases, were included in this analysis. Table 1 summarizes subject characteristics, dietary intakes, and
serum uric acid concentrations. Two hundred and forty
one (241) of the 9,384 participants were identified as
hyperuricemic (2.57%). Different mean values were
observed between hyperuricemic and non-hyperuricemic
individuals in regard to age, BMI, and intakes of energy,
natural and total fructose, total sugars, carbohydrates,
fiber, fruits, and alcohol. Approximately, 42% of all
added sugars are fructose (bound + unbound) and
added fructose can be over 80% of total fructose intake.
Uric acid concentrations and hyperuricemia occurrence
rates

The mean values of serum uric acid concentrations by
fructose, alcohol, and fiber intakes are presented in
Table 2. The data indicate no clear relationship between
fructose intake and uric acid concentration. The higher
fructose intake groups (by grams or percent of calories)
had either slightly higher or slightly lower uric acid concentration means in a random manner compared to the
group in the lowest intake quartile. The higher alcohol
intake groups (level 3 and 4) always had significantly
higher uric acid concentrations compared to the lowest
intake group, with or without adjustment; while the
higher fiber intake groups (quartile 2, 3 and 4) had significantly somewhat lower uric acid concentrations compared to the lowest intake group with or without
adjustment adjusted. The associations of alcohol and

fiber intakes with uric acid concentration also displayed
a dose-dependent tendency.
Figure 2 indicates hyperuricemia rates by quartiles of
dietary fructose intake. No clear trend of hyperuricemia
rates could be noted between quartile intake groups of
fructose that came from different forms or sources,
beyond subjects in quartile 1 who constantly had the
highest rates. In Figure 3, subjects in higher alcohol
intakes levels (3 and 4) exhibited higher hyperuricemia
rates; and subjects in higher fiber intake quartiles (2, 3
and 4) had lower rates. Figure 4 depicts a clear impact
of gender and body weight status, and a moderate influence of age, race, and education on hyperuricemia
occurrence. Men, obese subjects, and individuals over
50 y had significantly higher rates of hyperuricemia.
The risk of hyperuricemia

Up to 13 explanatory variables were used in the logistic
regression models to explore if fructose intake was associated with the risk of hyperuricemia in the adult

population. The outcomes of logistic regression on the 3
forms of fructose (added unbound, all added, and total
fructose), as well as alcohol and fiber, are reported in
Table 3. Odds ratios (OR (95% confidence limits)), corresponding P values, and results of goodness-of-fit tests
are included in this table. For fructose intake, subjects
in higher intake quartiles tended to have lower risk of
hyperuricemia compared to the lowest intake group (all
ORs < 1). Especially for total fructose intakes, a significantly lowered risk appeared in the unadjusted model in
subjects with higher total fructose intakes (OR = 0.5150.698, P < 0.05-0.001), tested either in grams or in %
kcal. However, the noted significances did not persist in
the adjusted models. Similar to previous reports, subjects in the highest level of alcohol intake were over
65% more likely to be hyperuricemic compared to those
subjects in the lowest intake level (ORs = 1.658-1.829, P
< 0.05 or < 0.001), with or without adjustment (Table
3). Furthermore, the highest fiber intake group was over
52% less likely to be hyperuricemic (ORs = 0.448-0.478,

without adjustment. Both of these dietary factors
demonstrate a dose-dependent influence on the risk of
hyperuricemia. The effects of all other dietary variables
examined, including total fat, protein, vitamin C, and
caffeine, did not reach statistical significance, except
that the higher energy intakes (quartile 3 and 4) lowered
the risk mildly in the adjusted model.
Among the demographic variables, gender, age, race,
body weight status, and education level all had a significant influence on hyperuricemia risk (Figure 4).
Women were about 58% less likely to be hyperuricemic than men were, OR = 0.418 (95% CI, 0.31-0.563).
Adults over 50 y were more than 100% more likely to
be hyperuricemic compared to people ≤ 30 y, OR =

Black adults had about 50% higher chance of being

hyperuricemic, OR = 1.506 (1.077-2.107). Unexpectedly, obese adults were at least 3-fold, and over-weight
adults were at least 1-fold, more likely to be hyperuricemic than adults with BMI values below 25, OR =
4.81 (3.214-7.198) or 2.445 (1.611-3.712), respectively.
Additionally, adults with the highest education level
(above high school diploma) seemed to be at lower
risk than adults with the lowest education level (under
high school), OR = 0.644 (0.46-0.901). For simplification, the detailed outcomes of logistic regression of
these variables are not reported.
To confirm the validity of the statistical model used,
goodness-of-fit tests were performed. The large P values
(0.17-0.87) of goodness-of-fit tests for adjusted models
indicated that the dependent variable (hyperuricemia yes
or no) could be satisfactorily explained by the independent variables.

Discussion
In this study, dietary fructose intake was examined for a
potential association with the risk of hyperuricemia in
adults, using the data contained in NHANES 1999-2004.
This work is the first effort to evaluate possible associations of various factors, particularly fructose, with the
risk of hyperuricemia using multiple U.S. national

nutrition survey databases. Dietary intakes of fructose
were not found to be associated with a higher risk of
hyperuricemia, while alcohol and fiber had significant
influence on the risk in opposite directions. Intakes of
protein, fat, vitamin C, and caffeine had no significant
influence on the risk. Unexpectedly, subjects in the
highest total fructose intake group (by gram or % kcal)

tended to have lower hyperuricemia risk (OR = 0.5150.715); however, the data are not strong enough to suggest that the higher total fructose intake may be linked
with lower risk of hyperuricemia. Differences in the
serum uric acid concentrations between the fructose
intake quartiles were very small (all under 5%). Some
concentration means in the groups of quartile 2, 3, or 4
appeared to be significantly lower or higher in a random
manner compared to the lowest intake group (Table 2),
and the observed concentration changes were not consistent with the outcomes from risk analysis. This result
suggests that clinical significance of the observed
changes in serum uric acid concentration is not of
importance.
Previously, Gao and colleagues [30] reported the influence of added sugar and sugar-sweetened drink intakes
(containing both glucose and fructose) on the concentrations of serum uric acid in the adult population from
NHANES 2001-02 database, but this work did not
examine relationships specific to fructose intake. Based
on the different model conditions, subjects in the highest sugar intake quartile had 3.8-6.6% elevated serum
uric acid concentration compared to the data of subjects
in the lowest sugar intake quartile. Those increases of
uric acid concentration reached statistical significance.
This outcome appeared to be comparable to our data.
However, our results from a larger sample size did not
produce an appreciable statistical significance for added
fructose, either with or without adjustments. Gao et al.
did not report whether the slight increase of serum uric

acid was linked with any clinical outcomes. Additionally,
as noted by both Gao’s work and ours, the means of
uric acid concentrations in different intake quartiles of
total sugar or fructose were all near the middle value of
the normal range. Hence, these observations indicate
that concentration alone might not be enough to explain
a potential influence of dietary sugars on serum uric
acid. Gao et al also reported that higher vitamin C
intake was associated with lower serum uric acid concentration in 1,387 non-obese men [31]. In the current
work, it was noted as well that hyperuricemic subjects
had an obviously lower vitamin C intake mean than that
of non-hyperuricemic adults (80.6 to 95.2 mg/d, Table
1). However, it was not seen that higher vitamin C
intake was associated with lower hyperuricemia risk.
The influence of fructose intake on risk of hyperuricemia was reported by Choi et al. [32] using older
NHANES-3 (1988-94) data. Choi and colleagues selected
a cohort age over 50 y; grouped them by fructose
intakes of < 10, 10-49.9, 50-74.9, and ≥ 75 g/d; and
reported a significant trend between odds ratios and
corresponding fructose consumption levels without
reporting comparisons between groups and 95% confidence limits of odds ratios. Because of the differences in
study subjects, categorization of fructose intake groups,
and criteria of defining hyperuricemia, it is less meaningful to compare our fructose intake outcomes with
Choi’s report.
Previously, the cut-off values >7 and >6 mg/dl of uric
acid concentration were used for defining hyperuricemia

in certain studies. To check whether the different definition altered our results, we ran the statistical analysis
using the lower cut-off reference values to define hyperuricemia for men and women, respectively. The results
obtained are very similar between the two sets of cut-off
values used to define hyperuricemia, except that prevalence rate was increased to 15.14% for the lower cut-off
compared to 2.57% for the cut-off used in the current
work. Table 4 shows descriptive statistics of hyperuricemia prevalence by levels of fructose, alcohol and fiber
intakes using the >7 and >6 mg/dl cut-offs. This outcome is not unexpected. Logistic regression analysis also
indicated: 1) no hyperuricemia risk increase in the
higher fructose intake groups, 2) significant risk increase
in the highest alcohol intake group, and 3) significant
risk decrease in the highest fiber intake group,

compared to the other intake ends. Consequently, our
conclusions are not changed by using either of the two
sets of cut-off points to define hyperuricemia.
Human experimental or interventional studies exploring the relationship between fructose administration and
serum uric acid concentration produced inconsistent
results. MacDonald and colleagues noted that serum
uric acid concentration increased about 10% within 90
minutes after a pure fructose drink (1 g/kg BW) in nine
healthy young men [10], while Emmerson indicated that
intakes of 250-290 g/d fructose increased serum uric
acid concentration 8-41% compared to glucose in three
healthy men [11]. Two fructose infusion studies (0.5 g/kg
BW, in 8 healthy young men and 4 gout patients) also
observed an increase of serum uric acid levels [12,22].
However, other studies did not observe increases in

serum uric acid concentration from fructose administration. In the Finland Turku sugar studies, 35 healthy subjects continuously ingested added fructose at a level of
2.1 kg/month (approximately 70 g/d) for 22 months and
had no appreciable increase in serum uric acid concentration or uric acid excretion [14]. Crapo et al [13]
observed that 2-week fructose administration at 24% of
daily calorie did not raise serum uric acid concentration
and urinary excretion in 11 normal subjects. Narins and
colleagues reported that 5-d added fructose intake at 100
g/d did not cause an increase of serum uric acid concentration in healthy subjects [22]. Also, Turner and colleagues reported that serum uric acid was not elevated after
drinking a beverage containing 90-154 g fructose in 6
hypertriglyceridemic men [15]. Likewise, the study by
Curreri showed that infusion of 100 g fructose did not
induce serum uric acid increases in 20 young men [16].
Moreover, Osei [17,18], Anderson [19], Koh [20], and
Grigoresco [21] all reported that long-term (1 to 6
months) intake of added fructose at 11-18% of daily calories did not influenced serum uric acid concentrations
in diabetic subjects. A possible explanation for the
observed inconsistencies in these intervention trials may
be differences in subjects and study protocols. Another
important point is that fructose administered alone may
produce very different absorption, metabolism and physiological effects compared to its co-ingestion with other
carbohydrates, such as glucose. A glucose co-effect was
documented by Riby et al concerning fructose malabsorption [33]. In ordinary diets, fructose is rarely consumed alone. We also noted in this work that dietary
fructose intake was allied with other sugars as indicated
by Pearson and Spearman correlations (both r = 0.94, P
< 0.0001, between intakes of fructose and total sugars).
In agreement with previous reports, high alcohol consumption (especially more than 30 g/d alcohol or 2
drinks/d) increased the risk of hyperuricemia by more
than 65% compared to adults who did not consume
alcohol (Table 3). There are a number of publications
that have investigated the links between alcohol

consumption and serum uric acid concentration. A proposed mechanism for dietary alcohol inducing serum
uric acid increase is related to high purine contents in
alcoholic beverages (beer) and to alcohol metabolism
which unusually causes adenosine triphosphate break
down to purines, as reviewed by Yamamoto [34]. The
agreement of our work and previous studies on alcohol
consumption and uric acid lends credence to the validity
of the logit model used herein.
In contrast, we did not find previously published literature examining the relationship specifically between
dietary fiber intake and hyperuricemia risk in the general adult population. A possible mechanism of higher
fiber intake associated with lower serum uric acid concentration and reduced hyperuricemia risk could be that
dietary fiber inhibits purine or adenine absorption in the
digestive system [35]. Also, higher fiber intakes are
usually associated with healthier diets (higher fruit and
vegetable intake) and lifestyle.
Beyond dietary and demographic factors, other aspects
may be more important in controlling serum uric acid
concentration. In a review by Luk and Simkin [36], it
was noted that inefficient excretion of uric acid, which
accounts for >90% of hyperuricemic cases, can be the
result of renal insufficiency of any cause that impairs
renal urate clearance. It was also reported that the kidney plays a dominant role in maintaining plasma urate
levels through the excretion process, and the normal
functioning of several urate efflux transporters in kidney
is critical for facilitating the excretion process [37,38].
Thus, normal kidney urate clearance performs a more
deciding role than dietary factors in hyperuricemia
development.
A novelty and possible weakness of this work is the
calculation method used to determine total fructose
intake. Due to the lack of fructose content data for
many food items in the databases, this work established
a method to estimate fructose contents in added sugars
and a method to estimate naturally-occurring fructose
contents in foods. Because of a lack of data for

Sun et al. Nutrition & Metabolism 2010, 7:16
http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/16

naturally-occurring sucrose contents for most foods, the
naturally-occurring bound fructose from sucrose was
not available for analyzing individual intake. However,
after careful evaluation, we realized that the amount of
underestimated bound fructose from natural sucrose
was small and would be evenly distributed in the subjects of each fructose intake quartiles. In the aggregate
population studied, the mean intakes of total sugars,
added sugars, and lactose were 135.91, 99.86, and 14.49
g/d per person, respectively. After subtracting the added
and dairy sugars from total sugar intakes, the remainder
would be natural sugars in foods. Most of them, if not
all, would be from fruits or vegetables. Thus, based on
the intake data of natural sucrose and total natural
sugars from fruits and vegetables reported by USDA
ERS [39], a ratio of sucrose to total sugars was calculated as 26.53% (a mean from 1990-2001 data). The
underestimated naturally-occurring bound fructose was
further calculated: (135.91- 99.86 - 14.49) * 26.53% * 1/2
= 2.86 grams, at the maximum, which is about 5.6% of
total fructose intake of the current study. Recently, Marriott and colleagues [40] reported estimates of typical
fructose intake data in U.S. population using food
group-specific fructose conversion factors and the same
databases (NHANES 1999-2004). The total fructose
intake mean in the adults (age ≥ 19 y) is 44.5 g/day
(recalculated based on the reported data by age group)
using an unweighted sample size. By using an
unweighted sample size, our estimate of the total fructose intake mean is 43.1 g/day in the adults (age 20-80
y). The values from the two different methods are in
close agreement. Moreover, Vos et al. [41] reported that
mean of total fructose intake was 51.8 g/d (recalculated
based on reported data) in adults with age ≥ 19 y from
an analysis of the NHANES-3 database (weighted sample size used). This estimate was also similar with the
result of our study (50.53 g/d, using weighted sample
size). However, the NHANES-3 data were collected
between 1988-1994, about 10 years earlier than the data
used in our work. Based on the assessments mentioned
above, this newly developed method for estimating individual fructose intake should be reliable.
In conclusion, higher dietary fructose intake was not
associated with increased risk of hyperuricemia among
adult participants in the NHANES 1999-2004; higher
dietary alcohol intake was associated with increased risk;
higher dietary fiber intake was associated with decreased
risk; and older individuals, males, or the obese all had
greater risk. Fructose administration under experimental
conditions (by acute high-dose ingestion or intravenous
infusion) may produce outcomes that are variable and
incomparable with those from fructose in ordinary diets
containing other sugars when relating serum uric acid
status. Beyond dietary factors, the impact of

demographic factors on serum uric acid concentration
and hyperuricemia occurrence continues to merit
attention.
