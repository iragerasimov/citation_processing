2. Futile or Fertile? Lessons Learned from a Novel
Geriatric Rehabilitation Curriculum

Objectives: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of
the 10-minute Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
and the 4-minute Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment
Scale (RUDAS) in screening for cognitive impairment
and dementia.

Andrew Perrella, Vicky Chau

Setting/Participants: 208 consecutive patients seen in
an outpatient memory clinic in London, Ontario, Canada
(63 with diagnosis of mild dementia, 86 with diagnosis of
mild cognitive impairment, 59 with normal cognition) for
whom both a MoCA and RUDAS could be completed.
Measurements: The MoCA and the RUDAS were
administered to all participants, sensitivity and specificity
of both measures were assessed for detection of cognitive
impairment and dementia.
The published cutoffs were assessed for detection of
dementia; MoCA (26) (Sensitivity: 98% Specificity: 24%)
and RUDAS (23) (Sensitivity: 85% Specificity 66%) and
for detection of any cognitive impairment; MoCA (26)
(Sensitivity: 95% Specificity: 54%), RUDAS(23) (Sensitivity:
63% Specificity: 93%.) Other possible cutoffs for both tests
may be more optimal. For detection of dementia a MoCA
cutoff of 20 was optimal (Sensitivity: 84%, Specificity: 70%)
while for the RUDAS, the previously established cutoff of
23 was optimal (Sensitivity: 85%, Specificity: 66%). For
detection of any cognitive impairment, the optimal MoCA
cutoff was 24 (Sensitivity: 93%, Specificity: 78%), and 26
for the RUDAS (Sensitivity: 88%, Specificity: 80%).
The RUDAS score variation with educational
attainment was significantly smaller than MoCA score
variation (p<.01).
The RUDAS is significantly briefer than the MoCA as a
cognitive screening tool, and demonstrated similar sensitivity
for dementia, with much better specificity for dementia and
cognitive impairment, when compared to the MoCA in an
outpatient memory clinic. Additionally, the optimal cutoffs

Older adults with functional impairment are cared for by
physiatrists in rehabilitation, but their training in geriatricrelated competencies remains sub-optimal. To develop a
geriatric rehabilitation curriculum, a needs assessment of
stakeholders was conducted to understand resident comfort
levels and learning needs.
We used a mixed-methods design for the geriatric
medicine (GM) needs assessment. Physical medicine
and rehabilitation (PMR) residents, physiatrists and key
informants completed a questionnaire (n=16; n=38; n=6)
and participated in semi-structured interviews (n=9; n=4;
n=6) to explore: the experiences of trainees in GM, enablers
and barriers to learning GM, and educational needs. Data
were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory.
The questionnaire revealed education gaps in drug
metabolism, delirium assessment, malnutrition and medication
management. Interviews highlighted 5 critical GM topics—
gait assessment, cognitive impairment, falls, polypharmacy
and frailty—and discussions on disposition planning, driving
assessment, frailty, and end-of-life care as areas needing
further curriculum support. “Geriatric rehabilitation” was
understood as a targeted, triaged, continuity of care to optimize
the function of older adults. Overall, comfort levels in GM
increased with exposure, but a high service:education ratio and
ageist mindsets remain prominent barriers.
At a systems level, there is a need for increased
involvement of PMR residents in the acute care of geriatric
patients. The current rehabilitation curriculum exposes
PMR residents to inpatient medicine, but gaps exist in the
education of “geriatric giants” and outpatient/home care.
Overall, participants identified numerous amenable barriers
that impede learning and practice.
Overall, physiatrists are uniquely positioned to assume
leadership roles within multidisciplinary teams. Our

targeted needs assessment identified learners’ needs – in
the form of knowledge, skills, attitudes and interests—to
ensure the applicability of a planned curriculum.

3. A Mobile Dementia Observation System (DObs):
Development and Pilot Usability Testing
Ari Cuperfain, Cecelia Marshall, Mario Tsokas, Karen
Chiu, Qiannan Zhao. Dade Sheng, Andrea Iaboni
Responsive behaviours in dementia, such as agitation and
aggression, are common and distressing for caregivers and
patients. A basic principle of assessment of behavioural
symptoms is to chart the behavioural patterns over 24
hour cycles. A widely-used tool for this assessment is
called the dementia observation system (DOS), which is
paper-based and onerous.
We have developed a prototype of a mobile
application, Dementia Observation (DObs), which
integrates information from nursing observations with
data from a wearable device on the observed resident with
dementia. We conducted usability testing of the DObs
mobile application. Both quantitative (system usability
scale, perceived usefulness scale, technological selfefficacy scale) and qualitative (cognitive walkthrough,
think aloud) methods of assessment were employed.
Post-test questions related to improvements and clinical
implementation were discussed.
Six assessors completed a scenario-based usability
test of the DObs mobile application. On average, users
completed 85% of tasks with all components correct.
Charting routine patient behaviours, took on average
51±31 seconds to complete the first time this skill was
assessed. This time reduced to 42±22 seconds when a
similar behaviour was recorded a second time, suggesting
rapid learnability. Other clinical considerations were
identified through user testing such as: collecting multiple
behaviours within a given time interval, clarifying what
constitutes an incident, and retroactive charting.
Usability testing showed DObs was both usable and
acceptable to clinicians. Areas of improvement with
respect to the mobile application were explored. The app
will be redesigned, and usability testing will be repeated.
Mobile technology offers an opportunity to improve
the assessment and treatment of responsive behaviours
in dementia. Future studies will examine feasibility in
clinical setting and develop machine learning algorithms
to synthesize behavioural, contextual and motion
tracking information.

4. Tailored Exercise for Frail/Pre-Frail Community
Dwelling Older Adults: TAPESTRY-TRIAGE
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

Courtney Kennedy, Larkin Lamarche, Doug Oliver, Lisa
Dolovich, Erin Haney, Alexandra Papioann
The purpose of the current study was to physically classify
prefrail/frail older adults participating in the TAPESTRYTRIAGE study using normative data (healthy seniors) from
the Senior Fitness Test (SFT).
TAPESTRY-TRIAGE is a 6-month pilot study that
examined the feasibility and effectiveness of a multi-faceted
frailty prevention program in community dwelling older
adults. For the current analysis, we evaluated the physical
function of participants using the performance based SFT
and included the chair stand test (number of chair stands in 30
seconds), the biceps curl test (number of lifts in 30 seconds),
the 2 minute step test (number of full steps completed in 2
minutes), and the 8 foot Up-and Go test (seconds). Participants
were classified as either below average, average, or above
average using SFT normative standards.
This study included 44 participants (64% women) with a
mean (SD) age of 79.7 (7.2) years. The majority of participants
were prefrail (77%) or frail (10%) on Frailty Phenotype.
The majority of participants scored at least average for the
following tests: the chair stand (75%), arm curls (73.68%),
and the two-minute step test (60%). Most of the participants
scored below average for the 8-foot up and go (78.38%).
Participants were comparative to norms that tested
upper-body functioning, but were challenged on the 8-foot
up and go test, which required lower-body function.
When developing home exercise plans, it is important
to consider each individual’s tolerance in each component
in order to prescribe a tailored program.

5. “I Would Hope the People Looking After Me Know
About Me”: Perspectives of Persons Living with
Dementia and Their Caregivers on Person-Centred
Care and Quality of Care
Bryan Franco, George Heckman, Sherry Dupuis, Lisa
Loiselle, Veronique Boscart, Linda Lee
Person-centred care has become synonymous with high
quality dementia care. However, persons living with
dementia and their caregivers have traditionally been
excluded in quality improvement and assurance efforts.
We explored person-centred care within the context of
quality of care from the perspectives of persons living with
dementia and their caregivers.
We present the preliminary analysis of interviews
with thirteen participants: 7 persons living with dementia
and 6 caregivers. Interviews were audio recorded and
transcribed verbatim. Qualitative descriptive analysis was
used to identify themes.
199

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
Participants generally defined person-centred care
as “care you would expect at home” and all participants
agreed that person-centred care is important to high quality
care. Three major themes about how person-centred care
impacted quality of care were identified: 1) clinicians’
ability to solicit what is important to patients, 2) effective
and appropriate communication to patients, and 3) patients’
ability to navigate health and community resources. A
clinician’s ability to solicit what is important for a patient
was touted as the most important aspect of person-centred
care. Some participants emphasized the need to facilitate
self-advocacy among persons living with dementia and
their caregivers to promote person-centred care.
Persons living with dementia and their caregivers
provide valuable insights into relationships between
person-centred care and quality of care, which can inform
quality improvement and assurance efforts. Person-centred
care, as understood from the perspectives of persons
living with dementia and their caregivers, is influenced
by proximal and distal factors at the point of care and the
health system, respectively.
The perspectives of persons living with dementia and their
caregivers are vital to clinicians and policymakers’ goal of
delivering high quality and person-centred care for dementia.

6. Cognitive and Physical Function: Further Evidence
of a Link
Lavan Sivarajah, ASM Borhan, Courtney Kennedy, George
Ioannidis, Ahmed Negm, Sharon Marr, Christopher Patterson,
Brian Misiaszek, Tricia Woo, Alexandra Papaioannou
This study aimed to determine associations among cognition
and upper/lower extremity function, frailty and activities of
daily living (ADLs) among older adults.
120 individuals (mean age 80.6 years, SD 6.32, 53%
female) attending a geriatric outpatient clinic participated.
Cognition was measured using the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MOCA). Extremity function was assessed using the Short
Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), grip strength, and
Timed Up and Go (TUG). Frailty was assessed using the Fried
Frailty Phenotype. ADLs were assessed using the Katz Index
and Lawton Scale. Participant characteristics including age,
weight, and height were also recorded. Relationships were
examined using Spearman correlations. Two-tailed p-values
of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
A significant correlation was found between the SPPB
and MOCA (r=0.19, p=.048) indicating that enhanced lower
extremity function was associated with greater cognitive
function. Of SPPB sub-tests, chair stands significantly
correlated with the MOCA (r=0.21, p=.04), gait speed
approached significance (r=0.19, p=.06), and balance was
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

not significant (r=0.07, p=.48). SPPB was not significantly
correlated with the MMSE (r=0.13, p=.18). Greater frailty
phenotype scores significantly correlated with lower MOCA
scores (r=-0.23, p=.02), and approached significance with
the MMSE (r=-0.18, p=.07). Poorer ADL scores (Lawton
Scale, Katz Index) were significantly associated with poorer
performance on the MOCA (r=0.48, p<.001; r=0.21, p=.03),
and MMSE (r=0.44, p<.001; r=0.18, p=.06). Age, weight,
height, grip strength, and TUG were not significantly
correlated with the MOCA or MMSE.
Both the MOCA and MMSE were associated with
frailty, lower extremity function, and ADLs, with stronger
associations for the MOCA.
Although the study’s cross-sectional design does
not allow for inferences of causation, the findings further
support an association among cognition and physical
function, frailty, and ADLs.

7. Health Outcomes Related to Receiving Care on a
Dedicated Acute Care for Elders (ACE) Unit Versus
Through an Acute Care for Elders (ACE) Orderset
Richard Norman, Samir Sinha
The Acute Care for Elders (ACE) model aims to reduce
common complications of hospitalization in older adults
including deconditioning, falls, and delirium. It incorporates
a series of interventions, including early involvement of
allied health, changes to the ward environment, speciallytrained staff, elder-friendly care protocols, and proactive
discharge planning.
Our hospital established a dedicated ACE Unit in 2011.
Because of limited capacity on this ward, however, some
patients admitted under an ACE orderset may receive care
on other wards. These ‘bedspaced’ ACE patients as a result
may not receive the same degree of focused interventions
available on the ACE Unit. Because of these disparities, we
sought to compare the health outcomes of ACE-designated
patients admitted to the ACE Unit versus bedspaced peers.
3308 ACE-designated patient admissions were
analyzed (1557 ACE Unit and 1751 bedspaced). The
primary outcomes were discharge disposition and inhospital mortality. Clinical complexity was characterized
using CIHI administrative data. Univariate and multivariate
comparisons were performed; logistic regression was used
to calculate odds ratios of the outcome measures.
In the univariate analysis, ACE Unit patients were older.
Complexity was similar between the two groups. Transfers
from another institution were more likely to be bedspaced.
In adjusted models, ACE Unit patients were more likely to
be discharged home (OR 1.28 (1.08-1.50), p=.003) and less
likely to die in hospital (OR 0.70 (0.51-0.95), p=.020) when
compared to bedspaced ACE-designated patients.
200

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
After correction for identifiable differences between
the two groups, including age, clinical complexity, and
other factors, disparities in clinical outcomes exist between
patients admitted to a dedicated ACE Unit versus those
admitted and cared for under only an ACE orderset.
Care of older adults delivered on a dedicated ACE Unit
is superior to care delivered with an ACE orderset alone.

8. Precipitating Factors for Delirium Among Nursing
Home Residents
Evelyn Cheung, Andrew Costa
Older nursing home residents are prone to delirium.
Most studies in the literature have focused on the inpatient population. This study aims to examine resident
characteristics that are associated with delirium in nursing
homes and the use of medications in this population.
This is a retrospective study on 1571 residents admitted
to nursing homes in Ontario, Canada between February
2010 and December 2015 over the age of 55 with no baseline
delirium. Residents with moderate or worse dementia were
excluded. Characteristics of residents were collected from
the Resident Assessment Information of the Minimal Data
Set 2.0. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to
identify variables associated with delirium.
Dementia (p < .001), the presence of acute pain
(p < .001), and the use of antipsychotics (p < .001) were
significantly associated with delirium at follow-up. There
was a significant increase in the use of analgesics (p < .001)
and antidepressants (p < .001) from baseline to follow-up
(~32 months apart) among those with delirium, compared to
those without delirium.
This study suggested pain be more closely monitored
and treated in nursing homes as it may contribute to
delirium. Further studies are also needed to examine the
prescription patterns in nursing homes to better serve the
nursing home population.
The presence of acute pain and the use of antipsychotics
were associated with delirium in nursing homes. Pain
monitoring and treatment may be important factors to
decrease delirium prevalence in nursing homes. In addition,
future studies are necessary to examine the prescription
patterns in nursing homes concerning the use of analgesics
and antidepressants.

9. Access to Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment
(CGA) in Lift Assist Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
Call Patients
Alyson Osborne, Sheri-Lynn Kane
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

When an individual requires assistance with mobilization
EMS may be called. If they do not receive treatment and
are not transferred to hospital, these are termed “Lift
Assist” (LA) calls. LA calls are associated with shortterm morbidity, mortality, and increased use of health
care resources. These high risk individuals may benefit
from a CGA. The purpose of this study was to determine
the percentage of older adults who access EMS for lift
assistance that have had a CGA in the 3 months before or
after the EMS call.
A retrospective chart review was conducted using
EMS call records and hospital database in the MiddlesexLondon area to identify the number of older adults who
called EMS for a LA in a 3 month time period (April 1-June
30, 2016) and to determine whether these individuals had a
CGA in the 3 months before or after the LA call.
227 LA calls were made by 183 individuals 65 years
and older (mean age 81). Twelve individuals (6.5%) had
a CGA in the 3 months before their call and 16 (8.7%) in
the 3 months after the call. Fifteen (8.1%) individuals had
their charts review by a Geriatric Emergency Management
(GEM) nurse in the 3 months prior to the call and 22 (12%)
after the call.
Only a minority of older adults who made LA calls
received a CGA in the preceding 3 months or the 3
months following their call. There is a gap in service for
these high risk individuals who could benefit from a CGA
but are not referred.
Strategies are required to link this vulnerable LA
population with specialized geriatric services.

10. Geriatrics in the Undergraduate Medical Education
Curriculum at the Schulich School of Medicine &
Dentistry: Medical Student Knowledge, Confidence and
Perceptions of Geriatric Teaching
Alishya Burrell, Saad Chahine, Laura Diachun
The purpose of this study was to examine mastery of
geriatric core competencies (GCCs) by clinical clerks at the
Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry (SSMD).
Medical students, at the end of clinical clerkship,
completed a test of knowledge on the CGS GCCs. An unpaired
t-test was used to compare score results between students
with and without geriatric electives. The questionnaire also
included questions on self-reported practices and perceptions
and confidence with geriatric topics on a 7-point Likert scale.
These results were presented using descriptive statistics.
Questionnaires were completed by 92 of 160 (57.5%)
students from the Class of 2017 at SSMD. The average mark
on the knowledge test was 86.5% (SD=10%). There was a
trend toward higher marks in the group that had completed
an elective in geriatrics (M=89.7±7.2%) versus those who did
201

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
not (M=85.4±10.7%), which was not statistically significant
(p=0.068). Confidence in managing older patients with
depression was reported by 74% of students, while only
53% and 40% felt confident with delirium and dementia
respectively. When asked if geriatrics was underemphasized
in the UME curriculum at SSMD, 64% of students agreed.
Only 37% of students felt adequately prepared to care for
older adults in their future residency.
Students scored well on the geriatric knowledge
test regardless of their exposure to geriatric electives,
demonstrating a basic understanding of core geriatric topics.
Key knowledge was therefore covered in pre-clerkship, or
in clinical settings. The majority of students felt confident
with depression and delirium, but still felt unprepared to
care for older adults.
Core geriatric topics are covered in the UME at SSMD,
however there continues to be room for improvement in
preparing students to care for older adults.

11. Nutritional Risk and Post-Operative Outcomes in
Elderly Patients Seeking Elective Surgery
Kady Goldlist, April Ehrlich, Hannah Stocker Cioltan,
Christopher Wendel, Rui Wen Pang, Kevin Evans, Jane
Mohler, Mindy Fain, Robert Bastron
The American College of Surgeons in collaboration
with the American Geriatrics Society have defined best
practice guidelines for the preoperative assessment of
geriatric surgical patients in their 2012 ACS NSQIP/AGS
Best Practice Guidelines. They classify severe nutritional
risk patients as either having a BMI <18.5 kg/m2, serum
albumin <3.0 g/dL and/or unintentional weight loss >10%15% within 6 months. In elderly patients undergoing elective
surgery, malnutrition rates could be as high as 38.7%. This
pre- and post- operative assessment studies the relationship
between nutritional risk and surgical outcomes.
ACS NSQIP/AGS nutritional risk was assessed in
137 patients (≥60 years old) undergoing elective surgery.
Subject characteristics and outcomes in severe versus nonsevere nutritional risk groups were compared with t-tests,
chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests, and for length of stay
truncated negative binomial regression.
The cohort had 25 patients with severe and 112 patients
with non-severe nutritional risk. Both groups had similar
mean age (77.1) and sex ratio (56% vs. 60.7% male).
Compared to non-severe risk group, patients with severe
risk had increased length of hospital stay (median 5 days
vs. 3 days, p=.015), increased surgical complications (28%
vs. 11.6%, p=.04) and were less likely to be discharged from
hospital to home (56% vs. 79.3%, p=.04).
Among all subjects, length of stay was estimated almost
2-fold higher in those at severe nutritional risk. We also
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

found that patients with severe nutritional risk undergoing
elective surgery were less likely to be discharged to home.
Nutritionally deficient elders are at high risk of poor
outcomes and early identification and intervention of
older adult patients at nutritional risk prior to surgical
intervention is warranted.

12. Information in a Flipped Classroom Model: a Study
on Retrieval Practice and Performance
Mark Stanton, Krista Reich, Andrew Tang, Michael Paget,
Kevin McLaughlin, Emily Kwan
The ‘flipped classroom’ is a teaching methodology that
provides learners with resources for independent review
prior to the scheduled classroom lecture. Geriatrics casebased multiple-choice scenarios focusing on diagnosis,
investigation, and management were developed. These
scenarios, termed ‘Cards’, were then used as resources in
our flipped classroom model. Previous studies by our group
have shown that access to Card scenarios directly correlated
to improved student performance. However, it is unknown
whether the number of Card scenarios available for a topic
would also impact exam performance. We hypothesized that
the number of Cards reviewed by learners prior to assessment
would directly correlate to improved exam performance.
Second year medical students (n=89) were given access
to the Cards prior to scheduled assessments. Seven Geriatricbased topics were used and a randomized number of one,
three, six, or nine Card scenarios were made available for
each topic. Questions representative of these topics were
then tested on a Geriatrics course evaluation and exam
performance was analyzed.
Early data analyses have shown that students scored
higher on exam questions that had more Card scenarios
available for review. Exam questions represented by one,
three, six, or nine Card scenarios showed average scores of
13, 50, 67, and 71% respectively.
A clear trend between increased Card scenarios and
better exam performance was seen. Further analyses of
student performance are needed to determine whether a
saturation effect becomes apparent.
In our flipped classroom model, access to a greater
number of Card scenarios correlated to better performance
on exam questions.

13. Decreased Risk of Falls in Patients Attending Live
Music Listening Sessions on a Geriatric Assessment
Unit: Results from a Non-Randomized Open-Label Trial
Julia Chabot, Oliver Beauchet, Shek Fung, Isabelle Peretz
202

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
Music is known to improve patient’s health, communication
and quality of life. Very few studies took place on shortstay geriatric units and no previous study has examined the
effect of music and the risk of falls. Our objective was to
compare the risk of falls by measuring the Morse Fall Scale
(MFS) score in patients from a Geriatric Assessment Unit
(GAU) who attended live music listening sessions versus
controls (no intervention).
A non-randomized open-label trial nested in a
retrospective cohort study (mean follow-up 14.8 ±7.5 days) was
done on a GAU (Saint-Mary’s Hospital, McGill University).
152 participants (mean age 85.7 ± 6.4 years, 88.2 % female)
separated in 61 patients in the intervention group and 91
patients in the control group matched for age, sex, cause and
season of admission, and place of living were included.
Musicians provided music sessions 3-4 times per week.
The MFS score upon admission, discharge and its variation
(before and after intervention) were used as outcomes. Age,
sex, place of living, cause and season of admission, MiniMental Status Examination score, length of stay, therapeutic
classes daily taken, and use of psychoactive drugs upon
admission were used as covariates.
A significant decrease in the MFS score variation in
the intervention group compared to the control group was
found (p=.025). The multiple linear regression model
showed an association between the decrease in the MFS
score variation and participation to music sessions adjusted
on patients’ characteristics (B=-19.0 with p= .026).
Possible explanations of our findings include the rhythmic
component of music and a higher motivation to ambulate.
Participation to music sessions was associated with a
decrease in the MFS score (lower risk of fall) in GAU patients.

14. Efficacy of Ondansetron in the Prevention and
Treatment of Post-Operative Delirium—a Systematic
Review
Nihal Haque, Raza Naqvi, Monidipa Dasgupta
Post-operative delirium (POD) affects up to 50% of surgeries.
It is associated with higher rates of functional decline and
death. Serotonin may play a role in POD. Ondansetron is a
serotonin antagonist with a favourable safety profile, and
could represent a therapeutic and preventive option in POD.
We performed a systematic review of MedLine, EMBASE,
CENTRAL and PsychINFO from inception to December 2015.
Initial screening identified 622 abstracts and three randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) met inclusion criteria.
Two RCTs examined ondansetron for the treatment
of POD. One study administered haloperidol 5mg or
ondansetron 8mg intravenously (IV) as a single dose to 80
delirious patients post cardiac surgery (mean age 71). Both
had similar reductions in their average delirium score and
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

patients with persistent delirium. Another study administered
ondansetron 4mg or haloperidol 5mg IV twice daily to 96
postoperative delirious patients for three consecutive days
(mean age 31). Both groups had similar delirium rates after
administration. However the ondansetron group received a
higher total dose of rescue haloperidol. Finally, one RCT
examined prophylactic ondansetron versus placebo to
prevent POD in 106 orthopedic patients (mean age 71). They
administered 8 mg of ondansetron or placebo IV once daily
for five days postoperatively. There were significantly less
delirious patients in the ondansetron group starting on day
3 and persisting to day 5.
The studies’ results could not be meta-analyzed due to
significant heterogeneity.
Ondansetron appears to be an efficacious agent for the
prevention and treatment of POD. Further large RCTs of
high quality are needed to confirm these results.

15. Goodbye PPI: a Quality Improvement Intervention
for Proton Pump Inhibitor Deprescription in Outpatient
Geriatric Medicine Clinics
Maia von Maltzahn, Jillian Alston, Nathan Stall, Yaser
Habeeb, Dov Gandell, Mireille Norris, Barbara Liu
Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of medication
identified by Choosing Wisely Canada where inappropriate
prescribing may occur, particularly when used long-term
without an attempt to discontinue or reduce the medication.
Older adults may be particularly at risk of medication-related
adverse events, including enteric infections, pneumonia,
acute interstitial nephritis, and nutrient deficiencies. As part
of a quality improvement curriculum, an initiative to reduce
potentially inappropriate PPI use was proposed, with a goal
to reduce inappropriate prescribing by 50% in outpatient
geriatric medicine clinics.
We performed a gap analysis between NovemberDecember 2016 examining PPI use among older adults
attending three academic geriatric medicine clinics in
Toronto, Ontario. A subsequent root cause analysis and
stakeholder consultation was held to determine factors
contributing to inappropriate PPI use. We next designed
a quality improvement initiative that enhances and
standardizes communication with the patient about PPI
deprescription, as well as facilitates recommendations to the
family physician about how to reduce or deprescribe PPIs;
we used a previously validated handout and deprescribing
algorithm. The estimated sample size is twenty-three
patients, and the first PDSA cycle will be completed at the
end of February, 2017.
Gap analysis findings indicate 53% of older adults across
the three clinic sites may have potentially inappropriate PPI
use, in keeping with the literature.
203

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
Impressions from the root cause analysis and
stakeholder meetings identified omission of the issue by the
geriatrician and suboptimal consultant communication as
factors contributing to the care gap identified.
A local care gap in potentially inappropriate PPI use
is apparent, highlighting the need for ongoing quality
improvement initiatives in the deprescription of PPIs among
older adults, who remain most vulnerable to the adverse
effects of inappropriate prescribing.

16. Frailty and Cognition in the Intensive Care Unit:
Preliminary Results
Samuel Searle, Alison Rodger, Steve Walsh, Leah Nemiroff,
Babar Haroon, Kenneth Rockwood
Frailty and cognitive impairment have important implication
on the care of those in the intensive care unit (ICU) as well
as in understanding health trajectories following ICU stay.
Despite this, limited research on these two conditions’
impact on patients in the intensive care unit has been done.
Single center prospective cohort study of individuals
>64 years old; expected to be in ICU for 24 hours. Planned
baseline and 1-year post enrolment assessments for frailty
and cognitive impairment performed using the clinical
frailty scale (CFS), care giver comprehensive geriatric
assessment, and IQCODE. Descriptive statistics were
performed characterizing the population. In hospital
mortality and length of stay and their associations with
frailty and cognitive impairment were performed using
SPSS. Reported here are preliminary results from the
baseline cohort.
Fifty-four participants (33.3% female; mean age
72.8) were enrolled. Prevalence of frailty and cognitive
impairment were 38.9% and 25.9%, respectively. Both
were present together in 22% of participants. A frailty
index, FI (mean 0.34) was correlated with IQCODE
(p=.006) and CFS (<.001). IQCODE and FI were not
correlated to APACHE II. Regression analysis showed
frailty and IQCODE did not predict hospital mortality
(18 died) and hospital length of stay while APACHEII
significantly predicted both of these outcomes.
Cognitive impairment and frailty were both present in
this ICU population and are described in similar prevalence
to previously reported studies. The associations reported
provide evidence to the validity of the pilot study population.
This study is underpowered for outcomes and also presents
preliminary results.
Both Cognitive impairment and frailty are highly
prevalent in the ICU and co-exist in the same individuals. They
will be helpful in better understanding health trajectories.

17. Potentially Inappropriate Medications (PIMS).
Hiding in Plain Sight? A Survey of Learners and
Internists on a Clinical Teaching Unit
Amandeep Kiddy Klair, Taleen Haddad, Allen Huang
Despite the established presence of potentially inappropriate
meds (PIMs) lists such as the Beers criteria, the in-hospital
use of such meds continues. A trial to reduce the prescribing
of these meds is in its pilot phase. We investigated the
current knowledge of learners and staff internists on
Internal Medicine clinical teaching units concerning PIMs.
Learners (clinical clerks and residents) and staff
Internists at The Ottawa Hospital were invited to complete
an anonymous web-based 12-question survey containing 5
knowledge and 7 opinion statements. The study ran August
23-November 15, 2016.
17/24 (70.8%) staff Internists and 66/119 (55.5%) unique
learners completed the survey. Learners included: senior
residents 9/17 (53%), juniors 42/60 (70%), and clinical clerks
15/42 (37%). Staff predictably did better than learners with
knowledge. The correct response rates comparing staff and
learners for 3 explicit drug questions were: 68% vs. 36%; 83%
vs. 57%; and 77% vs. 39%. Staff were more familiar with
the abbreviations PIM (29% vs 21%) & ADE (59% vs 33%).
Responses to opinions showed that 94% staff vs. 82% learners
felt that less than 15min was spent doing a meds review on
admission, while 77% staff vs. 56% learners felt that there was
teaching around adjusting meds for frail older patients.
The difference in opinions about teaching may reflect
reporting biases and provide a discussion point for future
modifications to the medicine teaching plan.
This study confirmed the presence of a knowledge gap
between Beers criteria, and staff and learners concerning
PIMs. The results are reassuring that the effects of the
future implementation of a trial to reduce the use of PIMs
will not be weakened by strong knowledge.

18. Evaluating The Clinical Frailty Score in the Intensive
Care Unit (ICU)

Frailty is a state of decreased physiologic resilience causing
a loss of functional reserve. It is a common premorbid
condition in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
(ICU), and its presence is associated with an increased
risk of adverse outcomes. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)
quantifies patient frailty between 1 (very fit) and 8 (very
severely frail) or 9 (terminal) using clinician judgement.
204

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
The CFS has been utilized in many clinical settings and is
familiar to geriatricians, but it is just beginning to be used in
the ICU. Furthermore, the validity of CFS scores generated
by chart reviews of ICU patients, where descriptions of
baseline function may be sparse, remains an open question.
From one ICU in Hamilton, Canada, 100 consecutively
admitted patients ≥18 years of age were enrolled in the study.
CFS scores were generated from chart review by 3 raters: a
research Coordinator (RC), an occupational therapist (OT),
and a geriatric medicine resident (GR). The RC chart review
involved examining hospital and ICU admission notes from
the index hospitalization. The OT chart review sources
were the same with the addition of information from prior
hospitalizations and physician outpatient consultations.
Reflecting the more comprehensive sources typically
reviewed by geriatricians to make frailty assessments,
the GR chart review sources included the foregoing, in
addition to hospital records elsewhere and home visit notes.
Additionally, the RC-generated a global CFS score using
data from patient and/or family interviews. Of 100 enrolled
patients, 100 were assessed by the OT, and 35 by the GR.
Comparison of CFS scores between different raters was
calculated as a mean difference (MD) using paired t-tests.
Of 126 patients screened, 100 patients were enrolled
from August 2nd to October 17th, 2016. Their mean
age was 64.3 years (SD=15.6, 3% females) with a mean
APACHE II score of 21.6 (SD=7.6). The CFS generated by
the RC chart review was similar to that by the OT chart
review (MD=0.19, 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.43, p=.12; n=100) and
to the GR chart review (MD=0.29, 95% CI: -0.47 to 1.04,
p=.45; n=35). When compared to the RC global score, the
agreement with the chart reviews are as follows: RC chart
review (MD=-0.23, 95% CI: -0.47 to 0.08, p=.06; n=78),
OT chart review (MD=-0.29, 95% CI: -0.56 to -0.02, p=.04;
n=100), and GR chart review (MD=-0.29, 95% CI: -0.90 to
0.32, p=.35; n=35).
We found no statistically significant difference in the
chart review-derived CFS scores of the different raters
(geriatrics resident, occupational therapist and research
coordinator), suggesting inter-rater reliability of this tool in
the ICU setting. The CFS values were also similar to the
global CFS scores which incorporate patient and/or family
interviews. Overall, these chart review-derived CFS values
tended to be lower than the global CFS scores. However
future research would be helpful to understand whether the
observed differences of less than 1 on this 9 point scale are
clinically important and prognostically relevant.

19. Depression Increases the Risk of Injurious Falls in
Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment. Results
From the Gait and Brain Study
Frederico Pieruccini-Faria, Susan Muir-Hunter,
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

Older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are
a vulnerable population at risk not only of dementia but
also of falls. Older individuals with depression are also
at risk of falls, particularly injurious falls. However, it is
currently unknown whether the presence of depression
in MCI individuals may exacerbate their risk of falls. We
hypothesized that MCI individuals with depression will
prospectively suffer more falls, and these individuals will
present greater gait disturbances at baseline.
Ninety seven participants from the Gait and Brain
Cohort Study were included in our project. Participants
reported falls and their consequences (e.g. injuries) twice
a year for three years using falls calendars and face-to-face
interviews. Gait during single and dual-task conditions
were assessed at baseline. Groups were stratified by:
cognitively preserved (Controls; n=25); MCI without
depression (MCI; n=50) and MCI with depression (MCI_D;
n=22). Cox-Regression analyses were performed to evaluate
the risk of falls as hazard ratios (HR) adjusted for age, sex,
cognitive status, executive functions, anti-depressants,
number of medications, physical activity level and previous
falls. ANCOVAs were used to compare gait performance at
baseline among groups.
Older adults with MCI and depression had increased
risk to suffer injurious falls compared to MCI (HR: 4.45;
95%-CI 1.74 – 15.39, p=.017); MCI_D group walked slower
compared to MCI and Controls (98 cm/s, 106 cm/s, 122
cm/s, respectively; p<.001). Other gait parameters remained
unaffected by depression even when individuals performed
a dual-task while walking.
Depression in MCI increases the risk of injurious falls
specifically. Gait disturbances may contribute to injurious
falls in this population.
Strategies to overcome depression in older individuals
with MCI may be crucial to prevent physical disability,
early institutionalization and death.

20. Burdensome Interventions and Antimicrobial Use
Among End-of-Life Ontario Nursing Home Residents
with Advanced Dementia
Nathan Stall, Hadas Fischer, Kinwah Fung, Susan
Bronskill, Peter Austin, Jeremy Matlow, Kieran Quinn,
Susan Mitchell, Chaim Bell, Paula Rochon
Older nursing home residents with advanced dementia have
limited life expectancies. These individuals often receive
intensive medical care towards the end-of-life thereby
incurring burdensome interventions and antimicrobials of
questionable benefit. We sought to describe the frequency,
nature, and predictors of burdensome interventions and
antimicrobials received by Ontario nursing home residents
with advanced dementia during the last 30 days of life.
205

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
Population-based retrospective cohort study using
linked administrative records. Logistic regression was
used to determine the patient and facility characteristics
associated with receipt of burdensome interventions.
We included 27,243 Ontario nursing home residents
with advanced dementia who died between June 1, 2010
and March 31, 2015. The majority (71.1%) were women
and the average age of death was 87.1 ± 7.2 years. Nearly
half (46.8%) were dependent for their basic activities of
daily living with 8.1% being totally bedbound. In the last
30 days of life, 21.8% were hospitalized, 8.9% visited
an emergency department, and 9.8% received medical
resuscitation. More than 1 in 3 (36.2%) were dispensed
an antibiotic, and 28.9% of residents received a physical
restraint. Male sex, fewer days in nursing home prior to
death, and lower income were all independently associated
with transfer to acute care and medical resuscitation, while
palliative care consultation, bedbound status, and older
age were negative predictors.
Many older Ontario nursing home residents with
advanced dementia receive burdensome interventions and
antimicrobial agents at the end-of-life.
The provision of care for these patients must align with
their life expectancies and goals of care.

21. Is Language Important to Deprescribing From the
Perspective of Canadian Seniors?
Justin Turner, Cara Tannenbaum
The extent to which “deprescribing” has infiltrated popular
vernacular among community-dwelling older adults and
how it triggers patients’ propensity to initiate deprescribing
conversations remains unknown.
A population-based telephone survey was conducted
from a sampling frame of all listed household numbers in
Canada, called at random. Eligible respondents were men
or women aged ≥65 years. Survey questions included;
awareness that some medications can be harmful in
seniors, initiation of a conversation with a physician to
stop medications, awareness of the term deprescribing, and
number and type of medications. Data were analysed using
descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and
associations determined with logistic regression.
Between August and October 2016, 64,043 households
were attempted, 24,884 answered, and 10,984 were eligible.
25% (n=2665) completed the survey (mean age 74, range
65-100). 17% (95%CI 16-19%) had consumed sedativehypnotics in the preceding 12 months. 64% (95%CI 62-65)
were aware that medications may be harmful. 41% (95%CI
39-43%) reported initiating a conversation with a physician
to stop medications. Only 7% (95%CI 6-8%) recalled
hearing the word deprescribing.
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

Responding in a language other than English was
associated with increased odds of consuming sedativehypnotics (OR 1.36 [95%CI 1.09-1.70]) and reduced odds
of knowing about harmful medications (OR 0.28 [95%CI
0.23-0.33]) or having heard of deprescribing (OR 0.64
[95%CI 0.43-0.95]). Knowledge of the word deprescribing
was associated with initiating a conversation with a doctor
about stopping medications (OR 1.50 [95%CI 1.10-2.04]).
Although many older adults have initiated conversations
about stopping medications, very few are familiar with
the term deprescribing. Prevalence and awareness of
medication harms varied with languages, suggesting
different approaches may be required across Canada to
promote deprescribing and safe medication management.

22. Cultural Factors that Influence Osteoarthritis Care
in Asian Communities: a Review of the Evidence
Thrmiga Sathiyamoorthy, Amanda Ali, Marita Kloseck
With the growing prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA)
internationally, there is a need to study its impact in
culturally distinct populations. Individuals of Asian descent,
both living abroad and in the continent of Asia, make up
more than 60% of the world population, yet comprehensive
information on the cultural factors that impact OA care
is not available. The purpose of this scoping review is to
gather evidence surrounding the cultural factors that impact
OA care in Asian communities.
Using established scoping review methodology, a
comprehensive search strategy was developed to capture
published literature across six databases. Of the 799
systematically screened abstracts, 75 articles were included
and coded using deductive content analysis. Codes were
grouped within a categorization matrix which spanned six
Clinical Practice Guidelines plus three additional areas
(identified to develop a comprehensive bio-psycho-social
categorization matrix).
Results reveal three major themes: (1) the importance
of family assistance with activities of daily living, (2) the
importance of culturally specific activities, and (3) distrust
in Western medicine. While Asians are more susceptible
to knee and hand OA because of cultural lifestyle factors
(squatting for chores, hygiene and religious activities)
and traditional beliefs, many do not present themselves
for conventional treatments (surgery or pharmacologic
interventions) until all traditional treatments are exhausted.
Our findings indicate that cultural factors impact the
uptake of OA management practices among Asians. Greater
awareness of these cultural factors may improve diagnosis,
treatment and management of OA among Asian patients.

23. Contribution of Medications to High Cost Healthcare
User Status in Seniors
Justin Lee, Sergei Muratov, Jean-Eric Tarride, Michael
Paterson, Tara Gomes, Lawrence Mbuagbaw, Kednapa
Thavorn, Wayne Khuu, Anne Holbrook
High cost users (HCUs) are patients who use disproportionate
healthcare resources. In 2011, 5% of Ontarians used 65%
($19.8 billion) of total public healthcare expenditures. We
sought to determine the contribution of drug expenditures
to HCU status to inform future interventions.
We conducted a retrospective population-based matched
cohort analysis of incident senior HCUs defined as Ontarians
age ≥66 years in the top 5% of total healthcare costs in fiscal
year 2013 (FY2013). Healthcare and drug utilization data for
the index year and year prior to HCU status were obtained
from Ontario’s linked health administrative databases.
Primary outcomes were the drug-to-total healthcare
expenditure ratio and annual total drug expenditures.
In FY2013, senior HCUs (n=176,604) accounted for $4.9
billion in total healthcare expenditures and $433 million in
medication costs. Compared to non-HCUs (n=529,812) on
a per patient basis, HCUs incurred higher mean annual
medication costs ($2453 vs. $842). Polypharmacy (>10
medications) was more prevalent (55.1% vs. 14.5%, p<.0001).
Although drug expenditures increased 1.7-fold among
HCUs relative to the preceding year, the ratio of drug-tototal health expenditures decreased from 40.2% to 8.9%
during their HCU year due to increased hospitalizations.
HCU use of higher-cost medications increased dramatically.
For example, compared to their pre-HCU year, prescription
claims for ranibizumab, biologic response-modifying
agents and monoclonal antibodies increased 9-fold, 60-fold,
and 120-fold, respectively (all p<.0001).
Medications are important contributors to HCU
expenditures, but their magnitude of contribution is
underestimated due to incomplete capture of costs associated
with outpatient chemotherapy and drugs dispensed in
hospital. In a subgroup of HCUs, use of a higher-cost drug
itself may trigger HCU status.
Further investigation of medication appropriateness
and cost-effectiveness in HCUs is warranted to improve
outcomes and/or contain healthcare expenditures.

24. Multimorbidity in Older Adults: Understanding the
Patterns and Progression of Multiple Chronic Diseases
Using a Pan-Canadian Electronic Medical Record
Database

Williamson, Amardeep Thind
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

Multimorbidity, the coexistence of multiple chronic
diseases, is a significant burden for older patients and
primary health care (PHC) providers alike. The research
objectives were to determine the patterns and progression
of multimorbidity over time.
Data were derived from the Canadian Primary Care
Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) electronic
medical record (EMR) database of longitudinal, de-identified
information from PHC practices across Canada. The ICD9 system identified chronic disease diagnoses and a list of
20 chronic disease categories identified multimorbidity.
The most frequently occurring combinations (unordered
clusters) and permutations (ordered clusters) were computed
using JAVA programming, and a multilevel time-to-event
analysis was conducted using Stata 14.1 software.
Among patients aged ≥ 65 years, 77.4% were living
with ≥ 2 chronic diseases and 58.6% were living with ≥ 3
chronic diseases. A total of 5,569 combinations and 9,551
permutations were detected among older females, while 4,021
combinations and 6,782 permutations were detected among
older males. The most commonly occurring clusters were: 1)
Hypertension and Obesity; 2) Dementia and Hypertension;
3) Cardiovascular Disease and Hypertension; 4) Cancer and
Hypertension; and 5) Diabetes and Obesity. These patients
experienced fastest chronic disease accumulation between
the first and second diagnosis, while slowest accumulation
occurred between the fifth and sixth diagnosis.
The majority of older PHC patients in Canada were
found to be living with multimorbidity. More specifically,
the clusters of multimorbidity were increasingly unique
patterns and the rate of chronic disease accumulation
indicated periods of quick progression.
This research explores the clinical profiles of older PHC
patients with multimorbidity using a national database.
This information can be strategically used to inform more
effective clinical care and health policy decisions for older
adults living with multimorbidity in Canada.

25. Prevalence of Geriatric Syndromes in Hospitalized
Older Adults From January 2014 to December 2016
Marcos Barrera De Jesus
To determine the prevalence of geriatric syndromes in geriatrics
service and to compare it with: a) the one found in another
hospital and b) the one reported in geriatric bibliography.
This was a descriptive and transversal study performed
in patients from the geriatrics service whom received an
integral geriatric assessment.
A sample N = 1,666 patients was considered, of whom
68% (n1 = 1,133) were women and 32% (n2 = 533) were
men; the average age was 82.7 years. The most prevalent
207

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
geriatric syndromes were frailty syndrome with 61.8% and
loss of autonomy with a 46.3% prevalence. In contrast, the
less frequent syndromes were faecal incontinence with 0%
and with 0.06%. Dental abnormalities had the same reported
prevalence in the other hospital and in literature.
The prevalence of geriatric syndromes in this study’s
patients were determined by: a) socioeconomic and cultural
status and b) homeostenosis, contributing these factors to
make patients more vulnerable to suffer them.
The knowledge about geriatric syndromes prevalence
in middle socioeconomic status population allows to
develop educational programs, health promotion, opportune
detection, physical activity and individual and group
interventions which improve the older adults’ quality of
life, as well as rationalization and optimization of sanitary
resources in different geriatric attention areas.

26. Are Frailty and Successful Aging Two Sides of the
Same Coin?
Ashley Bhullar, Robert Tate, Philip St. John
Successful aging and frailty have long been important
topics within geriatrics. It has recently been proposed that
they are opposite sides of the same coin. The perspective of
older adults themselves has not been explored. The purpose
was to determine if an individual’s definition of successful
aging was a mirror image, or opposite side of the coin, from
their definition of frailty.
A qualitative analysis of individuals’ self-definition of
successful aging compared to their self-definition of frailty.
We used data from the Manitoba Follow-up Study (MFUS).
This is a prospective cohort study of aging men who trained
as aircrew in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and have
been followed routinely since 1948. In 1996, an item was
added to the questionnaire: “what is YOUR definition of
successful aging?” and in 2015, an item was added: “What
is YOUR definition of frailty?” These definitions (from the
2015 questionnaire) were coded based on keywords from
each definition, and individual responses were compared
and categorized for successful aging; then compared toselfdefinitions of frailty.
There was a moderate negative correlation between
the successful aging and frailty definitions. However, the
concept of successful aging was more broad than simply
the absence of illness, functional impairment and frailty.
In particular, definitions of social relationships, leisure
activities, productivity, and spirituality were important in
successful aging.
There is some overlap of the notions of frailty and
successful aging. Yet, many individuals do not define
successful as simply the absence of frailty. Their responses
show that successful aging and frailty are not opposite sides
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

of the same coin. Additionally, their definitions of successful
aging do not fall into the traditional definitions proposed by
many previous researchers
Successful aging is not simply the absence of frailty.

27. Association Between Multimorbidity and Education,
Individual Income, and Household Income Among
Canadian Adults
Lindsay Torbiak, Suzanne Tyas, Verena Menec, Robert
Tate, Lauren Griffith, Phillip St. John
A lower social position is associated with adverse health
outcomes. There is less Canadian evidence for association
between social position and multimorbidity (MM). We aim
to determine if education; individual income; or household
income is associated with MM.
Secondary analysis of the Canadian Longitudinal
Study on Aging, a population-based study of community
living individuals aged 45 to 85. We used data from the
tracking cohort, which is intended to be as representative
of the Canadian population as possible, who had complete
data for all diseases (31 morbidities) and for measures
of social position (n= 18 871). We defined MM as two or
more chronic conditions from self-reporting of diseases,
excluding mental health conditions and acute conditions.
We constructed logistic regression models for the outcome
of MM, adjusted for age and sex.
Education was associated with MM: The adjusted Odds
Ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 1.38 (1.21, 1.59)
for those who did not complete high school; 1.03 (0.94, 1.14)
for those who completed high school; and 1.18 (1.04, 1.36) for
those with some post graduate education; with the reference
group being those with post graduate education. Individual
income was also associated with MM: the OR (95%CI) for
those with income <$20,000/year was 1.88 (1.64, 2.15); 1.37
(1.22, 1.53) for those with an income of $20-50,000; 1.22
(1.09, 1.37) for those with an income of $50-100,000; with
the reference group being those with income of >100,000.
Household income showed similar results.
Addressing inequality may have effects on population
health.
Lower income is associated with MM, and there is
a gradient in this effect. The association with education
is more complicated, but not completing high school is
associated with MM.

28. Location of Vertebral Fractures Is Associated with
Bone Mineral Density and History of Traumatic Injury
Jennifer Watt, Richard Crilly
208

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
The upper and lower thoracolumbar spine have been
associated with different biomechanical outcomes. This
concept, as it applies to osteoporotic fracture risk, has not
been extensively studied.
This was a case-control study of 120 patients seen in
an osteoporosis clinic. Vertebral fractures were identified
from lateral radiographs using Genant’s semi-quantitative
assessment method. Associations between bone mineral
density (BMD) T-scores and vertebral fracture location
were assessed. In an additional analysis, the association
between a history of any traumatic injury and possible
predictor variables was also explored.
The median age of patients was 75 (interquartile range
67-80) and 84.2% of patients were female. A vertebral
fracture in the lower thoracolumbar spine (T11-L4) was
associated with significantly higher femoral neck (p<.001),
lumbar (p=.005), trochanteric (p=.002), intertrochanteric
(p<.001), and total hip (p<.001) BMD T-scores. The odds of
having a femoral neck (odds ratio (OR) 0.24, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.07-0.75, p=.01) or total hip (OR 0.19, 95%
CI 0.06-0.65, p=.008) T-score < -2.5 was also lower among
patients with vertebral fractures in the lower thoracolumbar
spine. A fracture in the upper thoracolumbar spine (T4-T10)
decreased the odds of having a history of traumatic injury
(OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.76, p=.01), while a non-vertebral
fracture increased the odds of such an injury (OR 2.41, 95%
CI 1.10-5.32, p=.03).
Prevalent vertebral fractures in the lower thoracolumbar
spine were associated with higher BMD T-scores. Consistent
with this finding, the biomechanical literature has shown
that the upper thoracolumbar spine cannot withstand the
same loading forces as the lower thoracolumbar spine.
More research is needed to characterize potential
differences between the upper and lower thoracolumbar
spine and how this influences fracture risk.

Thematic analysis of semi-structured telephone
interviews with CGs (n=18) of persons with dementia
attending a geriatric specialty clinic that refers patients
to the Alzheimer Society’s First Link Program, and clinic
HCPs (n=7) was conducted.
14 female (78%) and four male CGs (mean age 71,
range 46-85 years) participated. 83% of CGs lived with
their care recipient. HCPs included nurses, case managers,
and geriatricians.
Comparisons emerged in four domains: 1) Internet: CGs
consulted diverse sources. HCPs felt CGs needed significant
help interpreting often low-quality information. 2) Primary
Care: Some CGs depended on their family physician for care.
HCPs identified the importance of effective coordination
between the clinic and FPs. 3) Community Supports: CGs
face systemic and individual barriers to access. HCPs report
feeling constrained in providing additional support by poor
resource availability and structure of services. 4) Clinic:
CGs value and trust the clinic’s services and staff. They
report feeling overwhelmed on first hearing the diagnosis
of dementia, and rarely recall information shared initially.
They appreciate opportunities to review information.
Between clinic visits, HCPs also provide instruction on
managing medications and challenging behaviours.
HCPs’ perceptions of barriers and challenges largely
aligned with those of CGs. Both emphasized the need for
reliable dementia education resources, more accessible and
available community services, and continual HCP support,
including after hours.

30. The Effect of Patient-Centered Care and Shared
Decision Making on Geriatric Patient Health Outcomes

Christopher Patterson, Sharon Marr, Brian Misiaszek,
Tricia Woo, Richard Sztramko, Peter Vastis, Alexandra
Papaioannou

Patient-centered care (PCC) and shared decision making
(SDM) are two approaches to care that have been praised
by health care providers and medical institutions. The effect
that these styles of care have on patient health outcomes is
still debated however. In a context where the population is
continuing to live longer, finding approaches to care that
may help improve patient outcomes and provide older
patients strategies to self-manage their chronic conditions
is imperative.

Health and social care systems depend on informal (unpaid)
caregivers of persons with dementia (CGs). CGs experience
significant psychosocial burden. Healthcare professionals
(HCPs) help mitigate this stress by educating, supporting,
and connecting CGs with resources. Our qualitative,
interview-based study compared the experiences of
accessing information and support by CGs patients with
dementia with the perceptions of HCPs.

Purpose:
The objective of this review is to determine what features
of PCC and SDM are associated with positive patient
health outcomes.
A literature search was conducted using three databases
(MEDLINE, CINALH, PyschINFO) and search terms
relevant to the research objective. The search yielded 456
articles, 11 of which were selected for the scoping review.

29. Comparing the Perspectives of Those Providing
Care to Persons with Dementia and Their Healthcare
Professionals

CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

209

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
Search Terms: Patient-centeredness, shared-decisions,
patient-provider relationship, health outcomes, chronicdisease management
According to this review, PCC and SDM have four
features in common associated with positive health
outcomes: information sharing, elicitation of patient
preferences, negotiation and consensus decision-making.
Implications: The integration of these styles of care into
clinical practice may help patients better self-manage their
chronic conditions, improve their quality of life, and in turn
pose less of a burden on the health care system.
Key Messages:
•	 PCC and SDM are two approaches of caring for older
adults that are highly recommended by medical experts,
despite mixed evidence in the literature.
•	 In addition to the improvements of quality of life for
patients, the implementation of these approaches may
help reduce the financial strain on the health care system.
•	 PCC and SDM styles of care share major themes that
have been attributed to positive health outcomes in
older adults.

Using the InterRAI -CHA Instrument

Middle eastern countries have certain cultural, social
and economic characteristics in common with similar
aspiration. The percentage of elderly in the Middle East
is expected to increase with improvement of the health
care delivery in the area. The region, like other developing
countries, needs to define the policies and programs that
will reduce the burden of aging populations on the society
and its economy. There is a need to ensure the availability
of health and social services for older persons and
promote their continuing participation in a socially and
economically productive life. The morbidity burden of the
geriatric population can quickly overwhelm fragile and
under financed health infrastructures which are unable to
meet fully the prevention and treatment needs of a younger
population with relatively low-cost, easy-to-prevent, easyto-treat illness
There is scarcity of research and publications in the
field regarding the ageing population in the Middle East
region. Abyad Medical Center & Middle East Network on
Research on Ageing-MENAR that are closely linked to the
Middle East Academy for Medicine of Ageing MEAMA
decided to do a community study on the elderly in Lebanon.
We selected the InterRai Community Health Assessment
CHA instrument for this study.
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

The main reason for selecting this instrument is the fact
that it is easy to apply in the community and it is a good
introduction to the various instruments of InterRA
The study was done in two places Lebanon and UAE.
Comparative data will be presented.
The goals of the study include among others collecting
data on the elderly living in the community in the Middle
East, in addition by using this instrument to be able to
compare various elderly community in the region and
comparing the region to the rest of the World.
The study will be able among others to identify
prevalence of dementia disorder in the community. In
addition to the possibility of comparing the health status of
elderly population in different countries

32. Challenges of Geriatrics and Gerontology Education
in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: Current Initiative
in Lebanon and Personal Experience
Abdulrazak Abyad
As we enter the 21st century, and increasing number of
older adults will reside, either temporarily or permanently,
in a nursing home. Assuming the majority of medical
care for this population will be provided by primary care
practitioners. For this reason , training in nursing home care
must become an integral part of the curriculum for internal
and family medicine residency programs. The changing
demographics of the population in the region have created
imperative for medical schools to increase their emphasis on
the education and training of medical students and residents
in the care of the elderly.
As the number of older people is growing and they
frequently have health-related problems with a mixture of
physical, mental, social and behavioural aspects. In the past,
these problems were seen only in a few older people and
the families were able to take care of their parents or old
relatives. However, societies are changing as a result of the
demographic and cultural developments and they face the
increasing possibilities of modern medicine.
In attempt to answer the above problem and
challenges The Middle-East Academy of Medicine of
Aging was started . The organisers of the Middle-East
Academy for Medicine of Ageing organise this course
with support of the European Academy for Medicine of
Ageing, the European Union of Geriatric Medicine, the
Geriatric Medicine Section of the European Union of
Medical Specialists and the International Association of
Gerontology. The aim of the Middle-East Academy for
Medicine of Ageing:
	
1.	 To improve knowledge and skills of professionals,
physicians, nurses and health care officers, in health

related problems in older people, starting with a special
interest in community care in the Middle-East area.
2.	 To harmonise the attitudes and goals of future opinion
leaders in approaching the health related problems of
older people in the Middle-East area.
3.	 To establish a network among physicians, nurses and
health care officers, responsible for the health care of
older people and those responsible for medical and
nurse students instruction, as well as general physicians
caring for aged people.
4.	 To stimulate scientific interest in the health related
problems in older people.
Abyad Medical Center and Middle East Longevity
Institute were instrumental in organizing the first
course of the MEAMA. Over the previous years, several
reputable official governmental, regional and international
organisations helped in the development of the academy
including The Health Ministers’ Council for the Cooperation
Council States, Ministry of Health in Bahrain, The
European Academy for Medicine of Ageing, The European
Union of Geriatric Medicine Society, the Geriatric Medicine
Section of the European Union of Medical Specialists, the
International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics,
medi+WORLD International, Multimedia Medical
University, Al Jinan University, Azm & Saade Association,
Hamad Medical Coporation, National Guard National
Guard Health Affairs -King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University
for Health Sciences and others.
A rising geriatric population, with increasingly
unmet health care needs, strongly suggests the necessity
for a better educational preparation of those health
professions actually or potentially serving them. The
absence of sufficient numbers of trained geriatricians
and gerontologists, among health professionals, seriously
undermines the ability of the country’s health care system
to adequately assess, treat, and rehabilitate the growing
ageing population. This shortage leads to inappropriate
care, higher costs, and poorer patient outcomes. Education
is key to more informed health care services, without
which, fertile soil exists for the emergence of negative
attitudes and stereotypes toward ageing and older people.
This may lead to avoidance and neglect of the elderly and
their problems. The Middle-East Academy for Medicine
of Ageing may help in preparing health professional
sensitivity to the issue of aging, thus help in improving the
quality of life of the elderly in the region.

CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

Older adults with cancer are complex and often overtreated or under-treated. Studies examining the impact of
comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in older adults
with cancer found a median of 39% of treatment plans were
revised after the CGA. These findings support the need for
CGA in older adults with cancer. In July 2015 a Geriatric
Oncology (GO) clinic was established at the Princess
Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Canada. We evaluated
patient referrals, impact on treatment, and patient and
referring oncologist satisfaction with our clinic.
Data on consecutive referred older adults (age 65 or
older) with any malignancy were captured in an electronic
database. Treatment plans pre- and post GO clinic were
obtained from the electronic patient record. Satisfaction
surveys were distributed to a convenience sample of patients
at first (n=50) and second (n=30) visits as well as referring
oncologists (n=15). Descriptive statistics were calculated for
all outcomes.
One hundred fifty new patients were seen in GO clinic
over the 18-month period. An additional 10% declined to
be seen. 45 patients were seen in the pre-treatment setting.
Of those, the GO clinic agreed with the proposed treatment
in 24 patients, recommended more intensive therapy in 2,
recommended less intensive therapy in 14, recommended
best supportive care in 1, and other modifications in 4.
The final treatment followed GO advice in over 90% of
patients. The GO clinic enhanced the supportive care
plan in 96% of cases. Patients, caregivers, and referring
oncologists were almost universally highly satisfied with
the GO clinic.
The GO Clinic has been well-received by patients and
oncologists.
The GO clinic has resulted in reducing over-treatment
and under-treatment in one-third of patients referred pretreatment.

There has been a recent increase in frailty intervention
studies including both singular and multi-modal approaches.
To consider their comparative benefits, we are undertaking
a network meta-analysis which allows simultaneous
consideration of treatment alternatives.
Objective: To describe the frailty interventions retained
in our systematic search and consider estimates of
comparative effectiveness.
211

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
Method: A systematic search of frailty intervention studies
that utilized randomized controlled trial (RCT) methodology
was conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE,
AMED, HealthSTAR, DARE, PsychINFO, PEDro, SCOPUS,
Scielo and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL), from the inception of each database.
Intervention key terms included: multi-faceted/multimodal/
complex, exercise, protein, nutrition, vitamin D, psychosocial.
To assess impact on frailty change, only studies that measured
frailty/related outcome longitudinally were included. Primary
outcomes of interest were: 1) frailty measured with any
reliable, validated method; 2) short performance physical
battery; or 3) a walking speed test. Secondary outcomes were:
1) cognitive outcome measures; 2) any physical performance
measure; 3) grip strength; 4) treatment cost; 5) Quality of Life;
and 6) adverse outcome. The full review protocol is available
at: PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016037465.
Overall, 6303 unique articles were retrieved from our
search strategy. Of these, 4% were retained for full-text
screening. In this presentation, a description of the final
types of interventions will be provided and an estimate of
effect of the different interventions on frailty change.

and HR-QOL and its change between baseline and follow-up
interview, using an adapted version of the EQ-5D-scale and
the analogue scale, while adjusting for confounding factors.
Baseline HR-QOL was negatively associated with
on-label use of AP compared to off-label use as measured
with the EQ-5D-scale [OR:-0.32] and analogue scale [OR =
-32.39]. The change in HR-QOL over the 3-year period was
positively associated with on-label use of AP compared to
off-label use with the EQ-5D-scale [OR=0.16] and analogue
scale [OR=13.26].
As compared to on-label AP users, off-label users
reported a better quality of life at baseline, but a worse
improvement in HR-QOL over the 3-year period. This may
be in part explained by a lesser degree of AP efficacy and
tolerability for off-label indications.
AP off-label use compared to on-label confers a worse
longitudinal improvement in HR-QOL.

Discussion and Conclusion: To date, this is the first
systematic review and network meta-analysis considering
the direct and indirect effect of interventions targeting frailty
prevention or treatment. Synthesizing the current evidence
of frailty interventions will help clinicians, researchers and
policy makers to determine the comparative effectiveness
of various approaches to prevent and manage frailty.

Quality of Life in Community Living Older Adults: a 3
Years Prospective Study
Hamzah Bakouni, Helen-Maria Vasiliadis
To determine the effect of off-label use of antipsychotics
(AP) on the health related quality of life (HR-QOL) of
community living older adult.
We used socio-demographically weighted data from
older adults living in the community and participating in the
«Étude sur la santé des ainés¬ (ESA)-Services» follow-up
study (n = 1020) and covered under a public drug insurance
plan. Off-label use of AP was identified via administrative
databases using ICD-9/10 codes and defined by the presence
of an AP drug during the year preceding baseline interview,
and the absence, during the 3-year period preceding baseline,
of a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major
depression. The absence of self-reported past year mania,
major depression and schizophrenia were also included in
this definition. Multinomial logistic regression was used to
assess the association between AP use (off-label vs on-label)

36. Canadian Geriatrician & Care of the Elderly
Physician Human Resource Update: 2016-17

At the 2016 Canadian Geriatric Society meeting an update
to the 2011–2012 human resources report was proposed for
2016-2017.
The goals were to update by province the:
1.	 Number and FTEs of internist specialist geriatricians,
their practice setting (academic health science centre or
community) and their job activity description (JAD) by
categories (clinical, teaching, research, administration,
leadership, other).
2.	 Number of internist geriatricians possibly retiring
within the next 10 years.
3.	 Number of Care of the Elderly (COE) physicians
working primarily as consultants or within specialized
geriatric services (SGS).
The list of geriatricians and year of MD graduation was
updated and compared to the 2011-2012 list.
Each provincial list of geriatricians has been distributed
to Division chairs and lead community-based geriatricians
to complete the:
1.	 FTE status of geriatricians.
2.	 JAD for geriatricians in their division or community
group.
3.	 Number of full time/part time COE MDs working as
consultants or within their region’s SGS. Communitybased geriatricians will be contacted by email/phone.
212

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
The overall number of internist specialist geriatricians
in Canada has increased by 38 to 324, a 13% increase over 5
years. However the population 65+ grew by 16.9%.
There are 25 active geriatricians in Canada 40 years
past their graduation. In the next 10 years, an additional 76
will reach this mark. Combined, they represent 31% of the
current geriatrician workforce.
The number of internist geriatricians has increased in
Canada over the last 5 years
To meet the potential retirement of 101 geriatricians in
the next 10 years, either 101+ geriatricians will need to be
trained in and/or recruited to Canada or opportunities for
part-time work become available for older geriatricians.

37. Subjective Memory Impairment and Gait Variability
in Cognitively Healthy Individuals: Results From a
Cross-Sectional Pilot Study
Olivier Beauchet, Cyrille Launay, Julia Chabot, Gilles
Allali
Increased stride time variability, have been associated
with memory impairment in mild cognitive impairment.
Subjective memory impairment (SMI) is considered the
earliest clinical stage of Alzheimer disease (AD). The
association between increased stride time variability and
SMI has not been reported.
This study aims to examine the association of stride
time variability while performing single and dual tasking
with SMI in cognitively healthy individuals (CHI).
A total of 126 CHI (15 without SMI, 69 with SMI
expressed by participants, 10 with SMI expressed by
participant’s relative and 32 with SMI expressed by both
participants and their relatives) were included in this crosssectional study. The coefficient of variation (CoV) of stride
time and walking speed were recorded under usual condition
and while counting backwards. Age, gender, body mass
index, number of drugs taken daily, use of psychoactive
drugs, fear of falling, history of previous falls, and walking
speed were used as covariates.
Results of multiple linear regressions showing the
association between CoV of stride time and types of SMI
adjusted on participants’ characteristics were reported
in Table 2. Only participants with relatives who reported
SMI was significantly associated with greater CoV of
stride time while backward counting (p=.038). When all
participants with SMI were polled together in the multiple
linear regression, no significant association was reported
(Coefficient of regression beta=0.48 with 95% confidence
interval [-1.38;2.34] and p=.607).
Dual tasking is used to measure the involvement of
cognitive function in gait control. It represents a more
sensitive walking condition compared to usual walking, as
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

this condition is associated with the very early onset of an
abnormal involvement of cognitive function in gait control.
Thus, our results confirm the assumption that there is an
association between dual task walking conditions and SMI,
suggesting that the very early stage of cognitive decline like
SMI is related to increased gait variability.
This study found a specific association between SMI
expressed by a participant’s relative and a greater CoV of
stride time (i.e. worse performance) while dual tasking,
suggesting that the association between gait variability and
memory may be present in the earliest stages of memory
impairment. Thus, gait variability under dual-task in
individuals with SMI expressed by their relatives can be a
potential biomarker of AD.

38. Association Between Falls and Brain Subvolumes:
Results from a Cross-Sectional Analysis in Healthy
Older Adults
Olivier Beauchet, Cyrille Launay, Gilles Allali
Falls are a consequence of gait instability. Cortical and
subcortical abnormalities have been associated with gait
instability but not yet with falls. This study aims to compare
the global and regional brain subvolumes between healthy
fallers and non-fallers.
A total of 77 healthy older individuals (23 fallers and
54 non-fallers, 69.8±3.5years; 45.5% female) were included
in this study using a cross-sectional design. Based on an a
priori hypothesis, the following brain subvolumes were
quantified from three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI using
FreeSurfer software: total white matter abnormalities, total
white matter, total cortical and subcortical gray matter,
hippocampus, motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, premotor
cortex, prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex volumes. Gait
performances were also recorded. Age, sex, body mass index,
comorbidities, use of psychoactive drugs, far-distance visual
acuity, lower-limb proprioception, depressive symptoms and
cognitive scores (Mini-Mental State Examination, Frontal
Assessment Battery) were used as covariates.
Fallers have more frequently depressive symptoms
(p=.048), a lower far distance visual acuity (p=.026) and
a higher coefficient of variation of stride time (p=.008)
compared to non-fallers. There was a trend to greater
subvolumes for the somatosensory cortex (p=.093) and the
hippocampus (p=.060) in the falls group. Multiple logistic
regressions showed that subvolumes of the somatosensory
cortex (p<.042) and the hippocampus (p<.042) were
increased in fallers compared to non-fallers, even after
adjustment for clinical and brain characteristics.
Regarding the a priori hypothesis, the finding in our
study of fall-related greater somatosensory and hippocampal
subvolumes was not expected. In fact, we hypothesized that
213

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
smaller brain volumes would be found in fallers since it has
been reported that gait instability (leading to falls) may be
caused by brain morphological abnormalities such as white
matter and/or subcortical gray matter ischemic lesions as
well as smaller cortical subvolume. One explanation for
this counterintuitive result could be based on the inclusion
criteria that included a healthy sample with intact cognition
and no gait instability detectable through a physical
examination. Thus, greater subvolumes in key brain regions
could represent compensatory brain changes in the context
of onset of gait instability. The fact that fallers had greater
gait variability compared to non-fallers is consistent with
this interpretation of greater brain volumes.
This study found that older fallers free of brain diseases
and peripheral gait disorders had greater subvolumes of
somatosensory cortex and hippocampus compared to older
non-fallers. These findings suggest a possible compensatory
mechanism based on the enhancement of specific brain
regions, specifically those involved in spatial navigation and
integration of sensory information. These brain correlates
of falls should be assessed in interventional studies that
focus on fall prevention in aging.

39. What Factors Influence Medical Student Interest in
Geriatric Medicine?
Szu-Yu Tina Chen, Janet Kushner-Kow, Sung-Hsun Yu
The lack of medical student interest in geriatrics medicine
is an area of concern, particularly with the increasing
need for physicians specialized in geriatrics care. Many
factors influence the choice to work with a specific
patient population, some of which include medical student
demographics, previous experiences with the geriatrics
population, attitudes towards the patients, and knowledge
about the elderly.
Our study analyzed these factors that influence
specialty choice through a 10-minute online questionnaire
filled out by medical students from all years at the University
of British Columbia. The relationship between these factors
was explored with two specific interest in entering geriatrics
medicine as a specialty and interest in working with the
geriatric population.
The study results demonstrated no relationship
between demographics or prior experiences with interest.
Comfort with the population was associated with both
interest in geriatrics medicine and working with the elderly
population. Geriatric knowledge correlated with interest in
a geriatrics medicine specialty, whereas attitude towards
geriatrics correlated with interest in working with the
elderly population.
Curriculum changes to increase medical student
interest in geriatrics are underway in most schools.
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

Our study suggests that a curriculum targeting increased
knowledge about the elderly, positive attitudes, and comfort
with the population would, together, increase medical
student interest in working with the geriatrics population
and in choosing geriatrics medicine as a specialty.

40. Solving the Mystery of Syncope
Karen Chu, Colette Seifer
Syncope is a common complaint in the ER. The incidence
increases exponentially with age. Our purpose is to describe
a case and literature review of an elderly female with
numerous episodes of syncope of diagnostic uncertainty. A
diagnosis and management plan was achieved through the
use of an implantable loop recorder (ILR).
A 66-year-old female presents with 3 episodes of
syncope over the past 6 months. Two episodes occurred
upon change in posture. The first, when she stood up
following a haircut and, the second, when she was getting
up to the bathroom at night. The third event occurred
while she was driving and resulted in an accident. Physical
exam was significant only for an asymptomatic decrease in
systolic blood pressure of 30 mmHg.
She was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope although
had atypical features such as minimal premonitory
symptoms and an absence of pallor.
Antihypertensive medications were discontinued
following her first episode.
Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), 24 hour Holter
and echocardiogram were normal. Tilt table test was
nondiagnostic. An ILR was inserted, and during a typical
episode, documented intermittent complete heart block
with 13 seconds of ventricular standstill. She received a
permanent pacemaker with no further episodes of syncope.
Syncope and falls are common complaints in older
patients. They are at higher risk of both cardiac and noncardiac related syncope. A detailed history is helpful to risk
stratify which patients may benefit from additional cardiac
testing. ECG, 24h Holter and tilt table testing are safe but
frequently non-diagnostic.
The ILR can be a useful diagnostic tool to assist with
diagnosis, especially in older patients with atypical symptoms.

41. Frequency and Quality of Delirium Documentation
in Discharge Summaries
Victoria Chuen, Rashmi Prashad, Vicky Chau
Delirium is characterized by an acute and fluctuating
disturbance in attention and awareness, accompanied by
214

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
cognitive impairment. While considered transient in
most patient populations, delirium in older adults is often
chronic and results in poorer prognoses. Considering
that delirium often persists long after a patient’s hospital
discharge, its documentation in the discharge summary is
crucial for ensuring adequate follow-up care. However,
previous studies have demonstrated that only 3-14% of
delirious patients have their diagnosis documented in their
discharge summary. Further, studies have been limited in
their scope.
We sought to determine the frequency and quality of
delirium documentation in discharge summaries.
A multi-centered retrospective chart review was
conducted across 3 major academic hospitals in Toronto,
Ontario, of patients 65 years and older who were admitted
to a medical or surgical service. Medical records were
abstracted for those identified with delirium during their
hospitalization using a validated chart-based instrument.
Our primary outcome was the frequency of delirium
documentation in discharge summaries. To assess the
quality of delirium documentation, we developed quality
criteria unique to delirium utilizing the Joint Commission:
Accreditation, Health Care, Certification (JCAHO)
framework for quality discharge summaries. These criteria
underwent review by a multidisciplinary expert panel
of geriatric health professionals. Demographics, quality
indicators of delirium care, and clinical and system variables
were also recorded.
Results are currently pending with data collection
underway. Initial results and data analyses will be presented.
We hope to provide a novel perspective on current
practices of delirium documentation. We will also explore
associations between measured variables and documentation,
and comment on its impact on patient outcomes.
This will be the first study characterizing both the
frequency and quality of delirium documentation in
discharge summaries.

42. A Novel Approach to Manage Challenging Behaviours
in Confused, Hospitalized Seniors
Monidipa Dasgupta, Lyndsay Beker, Kimberly Schlegel,
Corinne Coulter
Disorders causing confusion occur in more than 40% of
hospitalized seniors and are associated with increased
length of stay, cost, institutionalization and death.
Challenging behaviors include agitation or calling out,
and occur in 27-54% of seniors with illnesses causing
confusion. Drugs are often used to manage these behaviors
in acute care, even though they are not recommended and
associated with significant side effects. Some of these
behaviors may reflect unmet needs the individual has.
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

Understanding who the confused individual is personally
(his/her interests, abilities/disabilities, self-perception,
likes/dislikes, habits) can help to understand what the
individual needs.
In this pilot study, a structured interview (tool)
validated previously in the community setting, will be
administered to 20 patients over one year. The tool’s purpose
will be to identify individualized non pharmacologic
interventions that can be applied in an acute care setting.
The innovation involves approaching the management of
challenging behaviors in a novel manner, from what is
usually done in acute care. In so doing, it may decrease the
use of neuroleptic drugs or restraints.
Preliminary results of the pilot study will be presented.

43. Inter-Rater Reliability of the Retrospectively
Assigned Clinical Frailty Scale Score in a Geriatric
Outreach Population
Jasmine Davies, Jennifer Whitlock, Iris Gutmanis, SheriLynn Kane
Frailty, a common clinical syndrome in older adults
associated with increased risk of poor health outcomes, has
been retrospectively calculated in previous publications.
However the reliability of such retrospectively assigned
frailty scores has not been determined. The aim of this
study was to determine if the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)
could be reliably assigned retrospectively, based on
information in client charts.
Patients undergoing an initial consultation with a
nurse clinician from the Southwestern Ontario Regional
Geriatric Program from August 15, 2013 onward were
invited to participate in this study. As per standard
practice, a CFS score (CFS-I) was assigned during the
initial consultation. After patient consent was obtained,
a medical student researcher, blinded to the initial
score, assigned a CFS score (CFS-C) based on the initial
consultation note. The inter-rater reliability of the CFS-I
and CFS-C was then determined.
Of the 41 patients consented, 39 had both a CFS-I and
CFS-C score. The median CFS score was six, indicating
patients were moderately frail and required assistance
for some basic activities of daily living. Cohen’s kappa
coefficient was 0.64, indicating substantial agreement.
This study demonstrates that retrospectively assigned
CFS scores show similar accuracy to CFS scores assigned
immediately following a clinical assessment as evidenced
by the Cohen’s kappa coefficient of 0.64.
CFS scores can be reliably assigned retrospectively
thereby strengthening the utility of this measure.

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
44. Frailty Prevention in “At Risk” Older Adults in the
Primary Care and Community Setting
Grace Park, Antonina (Annette) Garm, Xiaowei Song
Research demonstrates it is possible to prevent and/or
delay frailty. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA),
patient directed chronic disease management planning and
health coaching have been identified as effective frailty
prevention interventions for older adults. The CARES
(Community Action and Resources Empowering Seniors)
Project combines all three interventions in a collaborative
inter-disciplinary model that introduces the CGA and
FI calculation capacity into primary care physicians’
electronic medical record (EMR)
Seniors aged 65 to 85 with an estimated clinical
frailty score between 3 and 5 receive personalized health
coaching for up to six months from Self-Management
BC at no charge. Before and post coaching, primary care
physicians conduct a CGA, which is embedded in the
electronic health record and able to calculate a Frailty
Index (FI). The effect of the combined intervention on
frailty is evaluated by comparing the baseline and followup FI-CGA scores and quality of life assessments.
Pilot studies CGA-FI scores of the participants
were statistically significantly (0.032) decreased post
intervention, which is equivalent to 2 less health problems
at follow up. Meanwhile, 59% of participants reported
an increase in their health attitude and 67% reported an
increase in exercise frequency.
CARES involves physicians, health coaches and
patients in the prevention of frailty. The electronic CGA, FI
and coaching provide both a measurement and management
strategy to address frailty in the primary care setting.
Results suggest CARES is effective in delaying
frailty. CARES empowers seniors to engage in selfmanagement of their health in partnership with their
physician. Together they are able to track and address
frailty development through the use of the electronic CGA
and FI results. Fraser Health has adopted CARES as part
of a senior care strategy. More research is pending.

45. Prescribing After Beers. How Well Are We Doing?
Taleen Haddad, Allen Huang
Despite the established presence of Beers and STOPP/
START lists as examples of explicit criteria for appropriate
prescribing, the use of potentially inappropriate
medications (PIMs) in the elderly is an ongoing problem
across clinical care settings. We investigate the scope
of interventions focused on deprescribing practices in
this population.
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

A comprehensive literature review from 1991 (the year
of publication of the original Beers criteria) to January
2017 was done using the electronic bibliographic databases
OvidMedline and Embase. Some of the MeSH terms used
were: “deprescriptions,” “geriatrics”, “frail elderly” and
“physicians.” The raw results from the initial search were
then screened to include publications from the past 10
years, which reported specific interventions or questioned
physician knowledge of polypharmacy and deprescribing
practices in the elderly.
16 articles were reviewed in detail from a total set of
211. These studies took place in the U.S., Europe, Australia
and New Zealand, in primary care, acute hospitalizations or
long term care settings. 6 of these interventions reviewed
were in tertiary care.
Family physicians consistently reported that they
had insufficient training on PIMs and deprescribing.
Barriers to deprescribing included: patient expectations,
time constraints and the challenge of managing multiple
prescribers. In the primary care setting educational
interventions in addition to pharmacist access and a decision
support system was effective in changing prescribing
habits. Reported mortality benefits were found only in nonrandomized trials.
There was no single successful strategy. Interventions
involving both the prescriber and system of care are
believed to be more successful, thus a standardized
guideline and decision-making tool for health care
providers would be beneficial.

46. Pulse Pressure in the Elderly: a Population-Based
Study
Sonia Hammami, Said Hajem, Mohamed Hammami
The sixth Joint National Committee (JNC-VI) classification
system of blood pressure emphasizes both systolic blood
pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for
cardiovascular disease risk assessment. Pulse pressure (PP)=
[SBP–DBP], may also be a valuable risk assessment tool.
Objectives: In this study, We evaluate PP in older population,
we examined the association of cardiovascular events
and diabetes
A Population based survey supported by WHO and
FNUAP. This study was carried out in a representative
sample of elderly aged more than 65 years. Standardized
techniques were used for blood pressure (BP). Hypertension
was defined as BP more than 140/90 mmHg. Diabetes was
defined as known diabetics. Regression analyses were used
to examine the relationships among pulse pressure age,
diabetes and cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction,
arteritis and stroke ) This project was approved by the
216

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
research Ethics Committee, CHU F Bourguiba, university
of Monastir
The study included 598 participants (396 women and
202 men) who were aged ≥ 65 years.
The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was
respectively 52 % (n=311) and 27,4 % (n= 164). Pulse
pressure was more than 65 mmHg for 132 subjects (22%),
only 43 subjects without a history of hypertension.
The mean of PP is significantly high in hypertensive
elderly (52.3 vs. 58.4 mmHg), with cardiovascular events
(55 vs. 58 mmHg), diabetic subjects (53 vs. 58 mmHg), with
comorbidity (54 vs. 58 mmHg) and polymedication (52 vs.
57 mmHg). Using pulse pressure (high PP ≥ 65 mmHg) as
dependent variable, the multiple regression analysis reveals
the independent influence of diabetes and cardiovascular
events on PP.
This study has confirmed that subjects with the widest
PP have the greatest risk of cardiovascular events
Elderly diabetic patients have a higher PP than
non diabetic elderly. These hemodynamic changes may
contribute to the increase risk of cardiovascular disease
associated with diabetes,

Sonia Hammami, Amine Yaich, Malek Kechida, Rym Klii,
Ines Kochtali, Mohamed Hammami
Late-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the elderly
occurs after the age of 50. According to several studies, lateonset SLE has particular clinical and biological manifestations,
and needs specific and proper therapeutic strategy.
This retrospective study (2006-2015) included 83
patients treated for SLE in Fattouma Bourguiba Hospital
in Monastir. We studied the clinical and laboratory
manifestations as well as the treatement features and
ouctomes of the twelve patients in the late-onset group
(group1) then compared them to the young patients (group2).
The incidence of late-onset SLE was 14.4%. The
mean age at diagnosis was 58.8 years. The cutaneous and
articular manifestations were the most frequent in our study
(75%). One patient had a lupus nephritis. Five patients
(41.6%) had pericarditis and 3 patients (25%) pleurisy. Four
patients presented thrombosis and one patient a pulmonary
embolism. One case of vasculitis with aneurysm was
diagnosed. The blood numeration showed 3 cases (25%) of
leucopenia, 8 cases (66.6%) of lymphopenia and no cases of
hemolytic anemia. The antibodies screening, found Antinuclear antibodies among all patients, anti-DNA among 9
patients (75%), anti-SSA and anti-SSB respectively within
5 patients (41.6%) and 4 patients (33.3%), anti-Sm in 2 cases
(16.6%) and anti cardiolipin antibodies among 4 patients.
We have treated 3 patients (25%) with immunosupressives
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

and 10 patients (83.3%) with glucocorticoids. The mean
SLEDAI score was 8.18. Three patients (25%) died. The
comparison of the two groups showed significantly lower
frequency of photosensitivity, malar rash and leucopenia in
late-onset SLE. Nephritis was also less frequent in the first
group. The antibodies screening results were similar among
the two groups. We have treated more young patients with
high doses of glucocorticoids. The mean SLEDAI score was
also higher in the second group. Osteoporosis and death
were significantly more frequent in late-onset SLE.
Late onset SLE is frequent and has some particular
clinical and biological manifestations comparing to
adult SLE.
It needs a careful and adapted therapeutic strategy.
Iatrogenic complications, comorbidities and senescence
may influence the prognosis of SLE in the elderly.

48. Business Planning for the Geriatrician —What is
Involved?
Nihal Haque, Alexandrea Peel, Michael Borrie
The University of Western Ontario Geriatric Medicine
Program has developed a dynamic transition to practice
curriculum. Fellows are offered four academic half days
dedicated to business planning and career mentorship, a
mandatory four-week administrative project rotation, and
a project management course. These opportunities are
used to develop their career planning skills so that they
can integrate into existing and develop novel specialized
geriatric services upon graduation.
A descriptive synthesis of material learned by the
fellows was compiled. Each fellow expressed their career
aspirations. Relevant mentors (including a representative
from HealthForce Ontario) were invited to speak at
academic half-days. Fellows received sample business
plans from other Specialized Geriatric Services in Ontario
and were required to make a practice case. They also
completed clinical electives in the locations in which they
were interested. The administrative block was then used
to understand the current landscape of the Local Health
Integrated Networks.
Fellows started business planning in their first year of
fellowship. This included having an organized approach
through the project management course, identifying
champions in their area of interest, delineating the
demographics and priorities in the area, developing an
environment assessment and ensuring adequate funding
sources to have a sustainable practice.
The geriatric fellows were able to explore and learn
from real world examples of new geriatricians entering
practice. Valuable lessons included best practices, problems
to be anticipated and mistakes to be avoided.
217

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
The Business Planning requirement of the Geriatric
Medicine program at the University of Western Ontario has
provided its fellows with valuable advice and support in
transitioning them to graduation. This is a model that could
be replicated at geriatric fellowship programs throughout
the country.

49. Implantable Defibrillators and Goals of Care—
a Patient Guide for ICD Deactivation
Karen Harkness, Elizabeth Berry, Stuart Smith, Heather
Ross
Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) have been
utilized for the prevention of sudden cardiac death. The ICD
continuously monitors the heart rhythm and when certain
arrhythmias are detected, a ‘shock’ may be delivered to
stop the arrhythmia and restore the heart back to its normal
rhythm. Although the ICD may help prevent sudden cardiac
death, patients often report significant pain and discomfort
from receiving a shock.
Approximately 30% of patients receive shock therapy
in the last 24 hrs prior to death. From a cohort of patients
with a ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ (DNR) order (n=65), 65%
had shock therapy programmed ‘on’ at 24 hours prior to
death, and 51% still had shock therapy active one hour
before death.
Evidence suggests that patients near end-of-life may no
longer want life-saving shock therapy from their ICD device
and in these situations, shock therapy can be disabled (‘ICD
deactivation’). Many patients are not aware that the choice
of ICD deactivation is available to them. The purpose of this
presentation is to highlight key messages from an education
booklet that was developed to help patients with an ICD/
family members understand options for ICD deactivation.
Methods: In 2016, the Cardiac Care Network (Ontario)
convened a working group in collaboration with multiple
stakeholders and patients/family members to develop
educational resources regarding ICD deactivation.
An information booklet for patients/family members
regarding ICD deactivation. and companion guide for
health care professionals (HCPs) were developed and will
be presented.
Discussion/Conclusion: Many patients are not aware of the
option for ICD deactivation and receiving unwanted painful
shocks near end-of-life.
Much needed tools are now available to help patients
with and ICD, their family members, and HCPs understand
the options for ICD deactivation that support a patientcentred approach to care.

50. Understanding Process to Improve Outcomes in
Elderly Hip Fracture Patients
Lynn Haslam-Larmer, Catherine Convery, Lindsay Crawford,
Gerry Hubble, Ellen Valleau
Falls are a leading cause of injury in older adults. There are
approximately 30,000 hip fractures in Canada per year, up
to 70% are women. Falls have found to be the direct cause of
95% of all hip fractures, leading to hospitalization, surgery,
and a potentially long recovery.
In 2008, our institution has developed a specific care
pathway to improve the processes following hip fracture
repair in the elderly. Prior to updating documentation in
2015, a quality improvement audit was performed to obtain
data on process measures and better understand barriers to
a timely discharge (goal of day 7 post operatively).
Retrospective chart audit. Twenty-five charts were
audited between June and August 2015.
The patients were grouped by length of stay (LOS);
those discharged by day 7 and those who had a longer LOS.
In those patients whom were discharge by day 7; the
average LOS was 6 days; the average age was 77 years. In
those patients who were discharged after 7 days – average
LOS was 12 days; average age was 87 years. Interestingly,
on average, patients discharged by day 7 had a catheter in
situ for less time than patients discharged after day 7.
This poster will review several pre operative, intra
operative, catheterization and mobilization processes
following a hip fracture admission.
A greater understanding of the processes during
hospitalization can help us to identify areas for future
improvement to obtain better outcomes.

51. Fear of Falling in Older Adults with Diabetes
Mellitus: a Scoping Review
Patricia Hewston, Nandini Deshpande
Fear of falling (FoF) is reported in both fallers and nonfallers and can potentially be more debilitating than a
fall itself. Several determinants of FoF overlap with the
consequences/complications of diabetes mellitus (DM)
which may contribute to higher FoF prevelence and severity
in this population. We explored the current research
evidence of FoF prevalence, severity and determinants in
older adults (age ≥65) with DM.
The search strategy involved a two-step process: (1) a
primary search of CINAHL, EMBASE, PubMed and Google
Scholar electronic databases, and (2) secondary search
of article reference lists and citation tracking. The search
included MeSH terms and key terms of: ‘diabet*’ AND ‘fear’
OR ‘falls AND self-efficacy’ OR ‘balance confidence’.
218

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
Based on the criteria above, a total of 11 research articles
were identified. Seven articles quantified FoF prevelence
(range:5-69%) with a single dichotomous question. Low
prevalence of FoF was reported when participants were
asked, “Do you have FoF?” (5%) when compared to “Are
you afraid of falling” (69%). FoF prevelence was higher
in those with DM-related complications of diabetic
peripheral neuropathy and/or pain. Four articles quantified
FoF severity with the Falls-Efficacy Scale International
(FES-I) and moderate-to-high FoF severity was reported
in up to 82% of older adults with DM. FoF was primarily
attributed to physical determinants, particularly, mobility
and balance impairments.
Emerging evidence indicates FoF is more prevalent
and of moderate-to-high severity in older adults with DM.
However, no studies investigated whether FoF is more
severe in older adults with DM when compared to those
without DM, and if FoF determinants beyond the physical
domain contribute to higher FoF severity.
Additional research is warranted to develop fallsprevention screening and intervention recommendations for
older adults with DM.

were on direct oral anticoagulants (56%) compared to
warfarin (44%). Prior to admission, 26.4% and 8.4% of
this cohort received antiplatelets and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, respectively. The median number of
medications identified through the patient chart, BPMH,
and the Ontario Drug Benefit program was 4(IQR 1-8),
5(IQR 4-8) and 8(IQR 4-12), respectively.
Nearly half of older hip fracture patients received
anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy at baseline. The
BPMH was most likely to identify these medications and
the total number of medications at baseline.
Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy is common
among hip fracture patients. Routine use of the BPMH
may decrease medication error.

52. Identification of Anticoagulant And Antiplatelet
Use Among Older Hip Fracture Patients: a Preliminary
Comparison of Medication Histories

To develop and validate our outcome scale that predicts hip
fracture in LTC residents over a one year time period.
Using the Resident Assessment Instrument –
Minimum Data Set 2.0 (RAIMDS) all residents with
a LTC admission assessment from Ontario, Canada
from April 2006 to March 2010 were eligible for study
inclusion (N=47,556). Residents were excluded from the
analysis if they had a high likelihood of not surviving the
one year follow-up period. All potential risk factors for
tool development were extracted from the RAI-MDS. The
RAI-MDS data were then linked to the Discharge Abstract
Database and National Ambulatory Care Reporting
System to collect additional data on the residents’ new
hip fracture status. The participants (N=29,848) were
divided into a derivation (N=22,386) and validation
(N=7,462) dataset. Decision tree analysis was conducted
to develop our scale. The c-statistic was calculated for
both the derivation and validation datasets to determine
the decision tree’s performance.
Of the 29,848 residents, 45% of LTC residents were 85
years and older, 2/3 were women, 1/3 had a prior fall within
the past 180 days, and 3% had a prior hip fracture within the
past 180 days. A total of 959 (3.2%) residents developed a
new hip fracture. Our scale has 8 risk levels of absolute hip
fracture risk, which ranged from 0.6 to 12.6%. A c-statistic
of 0.67 and 0.69 was calculated for the derivation and
validation datasets, respectively.
The tool may be beneficial as a Clinical Assessment
Protocol for standardized fracture risk assessment and
resident care planning.

Hip fractures among seniors increase morbidity, mortality,
function decline and admission to long term care. The
use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants may impact hip
fracture surgery timing, perioperative management and
clinical outcomes. We sought to characterize the number
of older hip fracture patients on these drugs using
medication histories obtained by different methods.
We conducted a retrospective chart review of older
adults (>65 years of age) admitted with a hip fracture
to Grand River Hospital, Kitchener, Ontario in 2016.
We independently reviewed and abstracted data from
consecutive records in duplicate. We used medication
histories obtained through the patient chart, the
pharmacist-obtained Best Possible Medication History
(BPMH), and the Drug Profile Viewer (Ontario Drug
Benefit Program) to identify the use of anticoagulants
and antiplatelets, and the number of medications prior to
admission.
In 2016, 179 older hip fracture patients were
admitted to Grand River Hospital. The majority were
female, with a median age 85 years (interquartile range
81 to 89 years). A quarter of these patients had premorbid
dementia. Of the 18% on anticoagulation, more than half

54. People of Dementia
Bonnie Dobbs, Lesley Charles, Karenn Chan, Jeffrey
Jamieson, Peter Tian
The presence of dementia in our world, and the
associated health care costs, is rapidly rising. Coinciding
with this is the widespread availability of information
sharing and collaboration on the world wide web. This
provides a unique opportunity to connect people with
content on cognitive impairment and dementia that is
moving and inspiring.
Through this project we will tell brief, meaningful
narrative stories about those living with a form of
cognitive impairment (such as dementia or mild cognitive
impairment, referenced from here on as dementia) and the
impact of this disease on those persons and their support
network. The stories will be found on a website (blog) titled
People of Dementia, which will be shared and discovered
through various social media domains (Facebook,
Twitter, etc). The project will focus on the individual with
dementia, highlighting who they were before the disease
onset, and how things have changed from a personality
and lifestyle perspective. The common thread will be the
enduring “person” behind the exterior that is obscured by
dementia. By allowing the audience to form a connection
with who the individual was prior to the disease, and
understanding the changes that have come as a result of
dementia to both the individual and their support network,
the goal is that the readers will have a greater appreciation
of those affected by dementia.
We will objectively analyze the impact of the project
by using Google Analytics to track web traffic and social
media data, and by obtaining feedback from viewers in the
form of an online survey.
TBD: Target for production story #1 = Feb 1, 2017. We
have received ethics approval from the University of Alberta.

55. Falls on Inpatient Geriatric Units: Which Tools
Predict Falls Best?
Jeremy Slayter, Chris McGibbon, Alexander McCollum,
Linda Yetman, Heather Oakley, Sharron Gionet, Rose
McCloskey, Pamela Jarrett
Falls in hospitalized patients are common and often lead to
adverse outcomes. There are multiple tools used in hospitals
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

to help identify those at risk of falls. This study evaluated
the characteristics of patients that fell compared to those
that did not fall using common tools to predict fall risk.
Retrospective analysis of all admissions to a 104
bed hospital with only geriatric units l from January 1,
2013 until December 31, 2015. Hospital units include:
Geriatric Evaluation and Management, Restorative
Care , Transitional Care and Cognitive Assessment
and Management Units. Databases containing patient
characteristics, standardized tools and patient specific
information related to falls were analysed.
Of 946 patients (age: 81.9±7.6 years; length of stay:
71±63 days) 301 (31.8%) had a total of 869 falls. The overall
falls rate was 8.48 falls/1000 occupied bed days. Logistic
regression showed that several measures at admission were
associated with falls (odds ratio, OR[95%CI]): Clinical
Frailty Scale (CFS)(OR=2.44[1.92-3.11]), Mini-Mental
State Exam (MMSE) ( OR=0.93[0.91-0.96]), Morse Fall
Scale (MFS) (OR=1.01[1.01-1.02]), Timed Up and Go
(TUG)( OR=1.03[1.00-1.05]), and Berg Balance Scale
(BBS)(OR=0.97[0.96-0.98]). However, Receiver Operator
Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that none of these
tools individually were good predictors of falls (Area Under
Curve, AUC<.7). The best performing measure was the
CFS, with a true positive rate of 45%, but also false positive
rate of 18% (AUC=.686).
Common tools used for fall risk assessment (MFS,
TUG and BBS) were not able to predict those at risk of
falling in this setting.
The CFS provided the best estimate of fall risk, but still
was unable to identify more than half of those who fell on
inpatient Geriatric Units.

56. Falls on Geriatric Hospital Units: What Information
Can We Learn from Reports
Linda Yetman, Chris McGibbon, Sharron Gionet, Heather
Oakley, Jeremy Slayter, Alexander McCollum, Rose
McCloskey, Pamela Jarrett
Falls are common during hospital stays for elderly patients.
There is great interest in effective Falls Prevention
Strategies to decrease falls and injuries. In 2013, a Falls
Prevention Strategy was implemented in Horizon Health
Network. As part of this strategy, post-fall reporting by
nurses was implemented. This study focuses on the post
fall reports by nurses.
Retrospective analysis of post-fall reports from
January 1, 2013 – December, 31, 2015 on inpatient
Geriatric Units. Data included time of day, location,
patient activity, environmental and medication related
factors. Patient data regarding balance (Berg Balance
Scale (BGS), mobility (Timed Up and Go [TUG]) and
220

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
cognition (Mini-Mental Status Exam [MMSE]) were
linked to the patients that fell.
The overall falls rate was 8.5 falls/1000 occupied bed
days (obd), (Range 5.6 to 11.5 falls/1000 obd per unit).
Most falls occurred while walking (26%) or transferring
(32%). The majority occurred in patients’ rooms (56%).
Patients who fell in their room/ bathroom had more
impaired balance and mobility (p<.001). Patients that fell
in the hallway or other common areas had lower MMSE
scores (p<.001). Environment and medications were not
reported as related factors.
The falls rate is consistent with previously published
falls rates but vary between units. The location of falls
varied depending on mobility/balance and cognition.
Commonly cited factors such as environment risks and/or
medications were not found to be factors.
Fall rates differ between Geriatric Units and patients
with poor mobility/balance fall in different locations
compared to those with poor cognition. Strategies that focus
on individual patient characteristics may be effective in
preventing falls in older patients on Geriatric Units. Further
research is required to explore relationships between
mobility / balance, cognition and locations of falls.

57. Health Impacts and Characteristics of Deprescribing
Interventions in Older Adults—a Systematic Review
David Mumbere-Bamusemba, José Morais, Marie Claude
Breton, Barbara Farrell, Anik Giguère, Danielle Laurin,
Michèle Morin, Caroline Sirois, André Tourigny, Martine
Marcotte, Edeltraut Kröger
In 2012, 65% of Canadian seniors had at least 5 prescription
medications. Changes in physiology, higher comorbidity and
medication interactions increase the risk of adverse health
outcomes from medication use, a risk further increased
by prescribing numerous medications. Not all chronic
medications may actually benefit seniors. In recent years,
deprescribing has been defined as a process developed to
balance the expected benefits from medications against their
risks, and leading to discontinuation of chronic medications
which are no longer beneficial. Deprescribing trials have
been performed, but evidence on the health effects of
deprescribing remains inconclusive.
We propose a systematic review to answer the following
questions: What are the health outcomes of interventions
to deprescribe, i.e. reduce the number or dosage of chronic
medications in seniors? What are the characteristics of
successful deprescribing interventions or elements thereof,
achieving positive or at least neutral outcomes on health or
quality of life in seniors?
The review is based on the Cochrane method for
systematic reviews of interventions and on the PRISMA
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

statement. The protocol is registered in PROSPERO. The
search is conducted for all relevant scientific databases
and websites and includes relevant grey literature. Study
selection, data extraction, intervention content and quality
assessment are conducted independently by 2 reviewers.
Meta-analyses will be performed for groups of
eligible studies. A Delphi panel will determine which
successful intervention elements are applicable to the
Canadian context.
This review will identify which deprescribing
interventions or components thereof are successful and
have a positive, or at least neutral, impact on seniors’ health
or quality of life.
Results will be instrumental for the development of
better interventions and guidelines to improve policies
regarding the challenges of deprescribing among seniors.

58. Does a Higher Drug Burden Index Contribute to the
Level of Functional Autonomy in Seniors, Six Months
After an Emergency Consultation for Minor Trauma?
Results from the Ceti Cohort
Edeltraut Kröger, Marie-Josée Sirois, Pierre-Hugues
Carmichael, Caroline Sirois, Emily Reeve, Lisa Kouladjian,
Nathalie Veillette, Marcel Émond
The Canadian Emergency Team Initiative (CETI) cohorts
showed that minor injuries like sprained ankles or minor
fractures trigger a downward spiral of functional decline
in 16% of independent seniors up to 6 months post-injury.
Seniors frequently receive medications with sedative or
anticholinergic properties, as summarized by the Drug
Burden Index (DBI), which has been associated with
decreased physical and cognitive functioning before. We
aimed at assessing its contribution to functional decline in
the CETI cohort.
CETI participants were assessed physically and
cognitively at baseline and 6 months later, including
medication taken at the time of injury. Functional autonomy
was measured with the Older Americans Rehabilitation
Score (OARS). Medication data were used to calculate
baseline DBI. Linear regression models assessed the
correlation between baseline DBI and functional autonomy
at 6 months, adjusting for age, sex, baseline OARS, frailty
level, comorbidity count and mild cognitive impairment.
557 study participants from one CETI site who had
medication data at baseline and complete follow-up data at
6 months were included in this study. In adjusted analyses,
a higher DBI at the time of injury contributed to a lower
level of functional autonomy, as measured by the OARS, at
6 months post injury: each additional point in the DBI lead
to a loss of 0.2 points in the OARS at 6 months post injury,
at p<.001.
221

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
The observed results are similar to those form other
cohorts studied elsewhere. Medication taken during followup may be included in further analyses.
Emergency visits are considered as missed opportunities
for optimal care interventions in seniors: identifying their DBI
may contribute to less functional decline after minor injury.

59. What is Known About Users of Medical Cannabis
Against Chronicmusculoskeletal Pain? A Scoping
Review of the Literature
Edeltraut Kröger, Clermont Dionne, Michèle Aubin,
Richard Bélanger, Guillaume Foldes-Busque, Laurence
Guillaumie, Martine Marcotte, Pierre Pluye, Mark Ware
Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP) is a major
cause of functional limitations and restriction in social
participation. Despite a large pharmaceutical arsenal,
effective therapeutic options for the relief of CMSP are
limited and often suboptimal. “Medical cannabis” (MC)
designates cannabis products intended for therapeutic
purposes. In Canada, 65% of the 32,000 individuals
who were given access to MC in 2013 had referred to
“severe arthritis” to justify their claim. So far, the stigma
surrounding cannabis and methodological problems
such as small sample sizes have limited the development
of knowledge on the effectiveness of cannabis in the
management of CMSP.
We performed a scoping review that examined the
literature on MC users dealing with chronic pain. The
search in databases such as Medline was conducted during
the second half of 2016 and was restricted to publications
in English, French, or German, without time limit.
The search identified 37 studies that met the inclusion
criteria. They were published between 1999 and 2017;
more than half had been published since 2014. Most
studies were conducted in the US (n=19) and Canada (7),
data were retrieved by retrospective chart review (3) or
relied on MC users’ self-report through questionnaire (26)
or interview (7). Sample size varied between 15 and 5,540,
with an average age of 28 to 55 years, and a range from 14
to 93 years. Only 2 studies were dealing specifically with
patients experiencing CMSP: 1 on fibromyalgia and 1 on
rheumatology. All studies had a cross-sectional design.
Knowledge on users of MC for CMSP is scarce.
More research on current users of MC against CMSP
could provide important new information on the usefulness
of MC to alleviate pain.

60. One Measure Does Not Fit All. Is the ADAS-Cog
Responsive to Important Changes in Pre-Dementia Studies?
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

Jacqueline K. Kueper, Manuel Montero-Odasso, Mark Speechley
The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive
Subscale (ADAS-Cog) is considered the ‘gold standard’
outcome measure of treatment efficacy for Alzheimer’s
Disease. As treatment efforts have shifted to focus earlier in
the natural history, such as in Mild Cognitive Impairment,
concerns have been raised about the responsiveness of the
ADAS-Cog. If the ADAS-Cog cannot detect clinically
important changes in these less severely impaired populations,
studies may falsely conclude that interventions do not work.
Objectives: 1) assess the responsiveness of the ADASCog to cognitive changes in pre-dementia populations,
2) review all modifications made to the ADAS-Cog to
improve its measurement performance in dementia or predementia populations.
Bibliographic searches were performed in electronic
databases to locate all studies using the ADAS-Cog with predementia samples, or reporting ADAS-Cog modifications.
Subject headings and key words related to ADAS-Cog and
dementia, pre-dementia, or cognition were used. Citations
from relevant articles were hand-checked.
Nine of the 11 ADAS-Cog items exhibit ceiling effects,
and the ADAS-Cog detects only slight changes over time in
pre-dementia samples. Statistically significant, but often small,
associations between the ADAS-Cog and several exposures
expected to be related to cognition in pre-dementia samples
were found. The ADAS-Cog detected treatment effects in 11 of
19 pre-dementia clinical trials, and demonstrated comparably
low statistical power towards treatment effects in 5 studies
performing clinical trial simulations.
Thirty-four ADAS-Cog modifications have been
evaluated. Eleven improved responsiveness to disease
progression over time, and 12 improved responsiveness to
treatment effects in dementia or pre-dementia samples.
While the ADAS-Cog can detect changes in cognitive
performance, modifications to scoring or item content improves
responsiveness in both dementia and pre-dementia populations.
The original ADAS-Cog may not be the best cognitive
measure for pre-dementia studies.

61. The Driving and Dementia Conversation: a Self
Learning Module for Health Professional Communication
Derek Lanoue, Anna Byszewski, Robert Parsons, Frank
Molnar
The development of a self learning module on communication
techniques surrounding driving with dementia provides a
much needed resource to health professionals as no such
tool exists. As of 2011, 747,000 Canadians were living
with dementia and it is predicted that number will rise to
222

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
1.4 million by 2031, nearly 100,000 of which being drivers.
Although initial diagnosis does not warrant immediate
removal of a patient’s license, as the disease progresses it
impairs one’s driving abilities, requiring frequent patient
follow-up and reassessment. The fear of ruining the
physician-patient relationship and dealing with emotional
response that often ensues along with the uncertainty of
available driving assessment tools leaves many physicians
unequipped to undertake these difficult conversations.
This online SLM (1.5 hrs) contains background material
on issues specific to dementia and driving, communication
strategies, links to resources and representative video clips (the
ideal and less ideal). The module demonstrates essential skills
in assessing driving safety in the context of cognitive decline
and teaches the learner essential skills in communication
using an adapted Calgary Cambridge Communication guide
with an interactive self-assessment format.
Preliminary evaluation of the module components
demonstrated increased willingness, comfort and
confidence for participants.
This multimedia module seeks to change clinical
practice surrounding challenging conversations about
driving and dementia in the long term.
This model of SLM can be used as a framework to
develop other SLM’s on difficult conversations such as
disclosing diagnosis, terminal illness and end of life care.

62. Is There an Optimal Cut-Off Moca Score That Can
Be Used as an Indicator of Dementia? A Scoping Review
Jennifer Lee, Andrea Chen, Jason Locklin, Linda Lee,
Tejal Patel
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening
tool that is widely used as an in-office test for detecting both
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. Cognitive
decline sufficient enough to interfere with independent
functioning is required for a diagnosis of dementia and
differentiates dementia from MCI; however ascertaining
functional impairment from patient history can sometimes
be challenging. A threshold score on the MoCA, below
which functional impairment is typically associated, could
help clinicians better triage those with cognitive impairment
who require more resource intensive in-depth assessment of
functional impairment. The aim of this scoping review was
to determine the empirical support for using a particular
score on the MoCA as an indicator of dementia.
The databases Embase, CINAHL, Medline, Pubmed,
and PsycINFO were searched using the search strategy
“(MoCA OR Montreal-Cognitive-Assessment) AND
(dementia) AND (diagnos*)” as well as associated reference
lists. Studies were included if they presented results from
English-language MoCA screening of patients with a
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

diagnosis of dementia or diagnostic criteria, and excluded if
they examined impairment due to other conditions.
We identified 20 relevant studies that met the inclusion
criteria. Of these, 17 presented optimal cut-off scores for
dementia, ranging from 17 to 26, with a median score of
20.5 (mode=17 SD=4.8). Participants were recruited from
specialist clinic settings (both for subjective cognitive
impairment and unrelated geriatric issues), and populationderived samples.
Researchers have examined optimal cut-off MoCA
scores as a screen for dementia, yet these scores and the
methodology vary widely. Further, no data are currently
available from primary care settings.
The research suggests a basis for applying the MoCA in
this way, but there is a need for further research.

63. Needs Assessment for Advance Care Planning in
Primary Care Collaborative Memory Clinics
Linda Lee, Jennifer Lee, Karen Slonim, Loretta M. Hillier,
Lindsay Donaldson
Primary Care Collaborative Memory Clinics (PCCMC) are
in an ideal position to support advance care planning (ACP).
This study aimed to identify ACP learning needs among
PCCMC health care professionals.
At an annual education event, PCCMC members
completed a questionnaire in which they rated their
knowledge of ACP (5-point scale: not at all – extremely
knowledgeable) and They rated their interest in learning
(5-point scale: not at all – very much so) various ACP
related topics (timing, documentation, communication,
supportive resources for patients and families, social and
cultural factors) and were asked to identify additional topics
of interest.
Surveys were completed by 58 physicians (MDs), 59
registered nurses/registered practical nurses (RN/RPNs),
25 nurse practitioners (NPs), 37 social workers (SWs), 9
occupational therapists (OTs), 17 pharmacists, 32 Alzheimer
Society staff members (AS), and 20 of other disciplines;
N=257. Mean knowledge ratings were moderate (M=3.0;
85% provided ratings of 2 - 4).Mean ratings of interest in the
ACP topics were all high, ranging from 3.6 for appropriate
timing to initiate ACP to 4.1 for educational resources
to support patients and families on ACP; ratings varied
significantly by discipline for some topics, though there
were no specific patterns to these differences. Additional
topic areas were generated related to capacity assessment,
health and financial power of attorney, public guardians and
trustees and other legal considerations.
Health care professionals reported moderate levels of
knowledge about ACP and they desired greater knowledge
in all areas (clinical and legal) related to ACP.

Ongoing professional education should focus on all
aspects of ACP.

64. Advance Care Planning in Primary Care
Collaborative Memory Clinics: Attitudes and Barriers
to Engagement Among Health Care Professionals
Linda Linda, Jennifer Lee, Karen Slonim, Loretta Hillier,
Lindsay Donaldson
Advance Care Planning (ACP) allows persons with
dementia (PWD) and their care partners to achieve shared
understanding of goals and preferences for future healthcare
decisions. The purpose of this study was to assess ACP
practices within Primary Care Collaborative Memory
Clinics (PCCMC) and attitudes towards ACP.
PCCMC team members completed a questionnaire to
assess ACP activities within PCCMCs and regular family
practice settings, as well as perceived importance of ACP,
attitudes, and barriers to ACP. Questions were rated on a
5-point Likert-type scale, with open-ended answers for
identification of barriers.
257 surveys were completed by physicians (N=58),
nurses (N=59), nurse practitioners (N=25), social workers
(N=37), occupational therapists (N=9), pharmacists (N=17),
Alzheimer Society representatives (N=32), and other
disciplines (N=20). Despite the perception that ACP is very
important for PWD (M=4.9), the majority of respondents
estimated that 40% or fewer PWD have had ACP
(N=141 and 133 for regular practice and memory clinics,
respectively). Ratings of willingness to conduct ACP
(M=3.7, 76% 2-4), and comfort level (M=3.4, 80% 2-4) were
moderate; however, these significantly exceeded ratings
of ability (M=2.9, 86% 2-4), and confidence (M=2.8, 85%
2-4), χ2(3)=72, p<.001. Mean ratings reflected perceptions
that the PCCMCs have a high degree of responsibility
for fostering ACP conversations (M=3.7, with 85% 3-5).
Barriers included lack of time and knowledge.
PCCMCs members view ACP as an important and
PCCMCs as a potential location to support this discussion.
However, their self-reported ratings of knowledge and
ability and level of comfort, confidence, and willingness to
conduct ACP were moderate.
To optimize ACP delivery, there is need to improve
health care practitioners’ knowledge, skills, confidence and
comfort with this aspect of care.

65. Recruitment for Dementia-Related Research in
Primary Care: Barriers and Facilitators
Miranda McDermott, Tejal Patel, Linda Lee, Karen Slonim
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

Recruitment from primary care has been identified as a
way to increase enrollment into dementia-related research
studies. The objective of this scoping review was to identify
literature that examined common facilitators and barriers
for recruitment in dementia-related research in primary
care settings.
A search was performed for English articles from the
past 10 years in the PubMed database using keywords
and MESH terms such as “dementia” or “mild cognitive
impairment”; “primary care” or “general practice”; and
“recruit*” or “patient selection”, which yielded 154 articles.
Articles were excluded (n=145) if recruitment methods or
dementia-related research was not studied, if the setting was
not primary care, or if it was an opinion paper. The final
sample included eight studies and one guideline.
Five studies looked at engaging physicians in dementiarelated research; common barriers included physicians’
lack of time to participate and potential risks to patients
participating in research, and common facilitators included
reducing the time burden of participation, online methods
of study participation, and improving knowledge about
dementia and its diagnosis. The guideline focused on
research assistants’ approach to recruitment of dementia
patients. No common barriers of facilitators could be
ascertained in studies addressing recruitment of patients
with dementia (2/8) or their caregivers (1/8) in primary
care. No study reported ethical dilemmas of recruitment of
patients with dementia.
Study participants, aims and methodology, and aims
of the research projects recruiting patients with dementia
varied widely.
Some literature exists on the recruitment of primary
care physicians to participate into dementia-related research
studies; however, gaps in the literature remain with regards
to the recruitment of patients with dementia or their care
partners. Further research is needed.

66. Educational and Organizational Approaches for
Preventing and Reducing Harm From Falls: Two
Systematic Reviews to Inform a Best Practice Guideline
Laura Legere, Susan McNeill, Julie Blain, Robert Lam,
Michelle Rey
Falls among older adults commonly occur and have
devastating impacts. Prevention is complex and requires
clinical excellence and concerted efforts in health-care
organizations. We conducted two systematic reviews as
part of an initiative to develop a best practice guideline
on fall prevention. The reviews addressed 1) educational
approaches needed to educate health-care providers on fall
prevention/injury reduction, and 2) organizational supports
needed to prevent falls/injury from falls.
224

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
Two comprehensive searches were developed to
examine educational and organizational fall prevention
strategies and were conducted in seven and five academic
health databases respectively. The search was limited to
English language reviews of research published between
2011 and 2016, focusing on prevention of falls in adults.
Reviews were independently screened for inclusion by
two nurse researchers, with discrepancies tie-broken by
a third. Research narrative summaries were generated
following data extraction and quality appraisal of
included reviews.
18 reviews were included. Eight reviews on educational
strategies were identified that examined professional
development for health-care staff in acute and long-term
care settings. Some evidence suggests incorporating staff
education into a multi-factorial prevention approach
may reduce falls; however, there exists a lack of strong
evidence to indicate how staff education may also be
used as an implementation strategy for other fall
prevention programs. In ten reviews on organizational
approaches, multi-factorial prevention programs
implemented by acute care settings showed some
effectiveness, although the methodological quality of the
reviews was weak.
Few numbers of high-quality reviews examining
educational and organizational approaches for preventing
falls were identified.
The existing evidence suggests support for multifactorial approaches implemented at an organizational level
that incorporate an element of staff education; however,
further high-quality research is needed.

Patient/caregiver satisfaction and quality of care
transition was assessed using the Care Transitions Measure©
(CTM-3) and the NRC picker survey. The compliance of
medication reconciliation using the best medication history,
re-admission rates to Hôpital Montfort and the number of
confirmed family physician appointments post-discharge
were tracked.
The APN in a role of Care Transition Coach provides an
opportunity to implement best practices while improving
care of the older adult during the transition from hospital
to home.
As of April 2017, we expect a decrease in re-admission
rates of patients followed by the CTC and a increase in
patient satisfaction, demonstrating the impact of the APNbased CTC role.

67. Transition Coach (CTC) to Assist Frail Seniors in
Transition from Hospital to the Community

Setting: FPs practicing in a variety of settings: Primary
Care, Day Programs, Home Living, Supportive/Assisted
Living, Long-term Care, Restorative Care, Geriatric Clinic,
and Geriatric inpatient/rehabilitation units in the Edmonton
Zone, Alberta.

Carreau, El Moustafa Bouattane, John Joanisse, Linda
Lessard, Mélanie Filion
Literature has reported that serious deficiencies in quality
exist for patients undergoing transitions across sites of
care. As part of a partnership with the Foundation for
Health Care improvement and as a Best Practice Spotlight
Organization, Hôpital Montfort has piloted a transition of
care project using a CTC to improve care for frail seniors
upon discharge from hospital to community.
An Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) led committee
developed the new CTC role for high risk seniors admitted
to medicine. The team used RNAO Best Practice Guidelines
to better address chronic disease self-management and
transition (from hospital to home) for patients and caregivers
through visit(s) during hospitalization and with one to two
post discharge phone calls.

68. Decision-Making Capacity Assessment Education
for Physicians
Charles Lesley, Jasneet Parmar, Suzette Bremault-Phillips,
Bonnie Dobbs, Sacry Lori, Slugett Bryan
The objective of this study was to examine the training
needs of family physicians (FPs) regarding DecisionMaking Capacity Assessments (DMCAs) and ways in
which training materials, based on a DMCA Model, might
be adapted for use by FPs.
Design: A scoping review of the literature and qualitative
research methodology (focus groups and structured
interviews).

Participants: FPs who chose to attend a focus group on
DMCAs.
A scoping review of the literature to examine the
current status of physician education regarding assessment
of decision-making capacity (DMC), and a focus group and
interviews with FPs to ascertain the educational needs of
FPs in this area.
Based on the scoping review of the literature, four
main themes emerged: increasing saliency of DMCAs due
to an aging population, sub-optimal DMCA training for
physicians, inconsistent approaches to DMCA, and tension
between autonomy and protection.
The findings of the focus groups and interviews indicate
that, while FPs working as independent practitioners or on
inter-professional (IP) teams are motivated to engage in
225

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
DMCAs and utilize the DMCA Model for those assessments,
several factors impede them from conducting DMCAs. The
most notable factors are a lack of education, isolation from IP
teams, uneasiness around managing conflict with families,
fear of liability, and concerns regarding remuneration.
This research project has helped to inform ways to
better train and support FPs conducting DMCAs.
FPs are well-positioned, with proper training, to
effectively conduct DMCAs. To engage in the process,
however, the barriers should be addressed.

69. Osteomyelitis and Myocardial Infarction, Severe
Complications of Pancytopenia Associated With
Leflunomide Toxicity in an Older Adult: a Case Report
Brendan Lew, Denise Keller, Joanne M.W. Ho, Shelley Parker
Pancytopenia is a potential consequence of leflunomide,
a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug for autoimmune
disorders. Older adults may be vulnerable to this adverse
effect due to multimorbidity and polypharmacy, particularly
when lower socioeconomic status complicates the drug
monitoring process.
A 73-year-old man presented to emergency with
weakness, melena, diarrhea, dysphagia and dyspnea.
His past medical history included rheumatoid arthritis,
hypertension, cholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and
ischemic heart disease. His rheumatoid arthritis was stable
since adding leflunomide to methotrexate therapy 6 months
ago. His work as a courier prevented him from receiving his
routine bloodwork in the preceding months.
On admission, he was febrile, pancytopenic and fulfilled
criteria for acute coronary syndrome and osteomyelitis. He
received packed red blood cell and platelet transfusions,
leucovorin rescue, neupogen and antibiotics. On day 3, the
admission methotrexate level returned as negligible and his
pancytopenia persisted therefore cholestyramine therapy
was initiated to enhance leflunomide excretion. His cell
counts rapidly recovered and he was discharged home.
Leflunomide’s active metabolite, teriflunomide, has a
long half-life of 15-18 days due to enterohepatic recycling,
requiring up to 2 months to reach steady state Cholestyramine
accelerates drug excretion and is an inexpensive treatment for a
life-threatening toxicity, with better tolerability than activated
charcoal. An Australian report showed the risk of pancytopenia
with leflunomide increased 7-fold when used in combination
with methotrexate. Therefore, monitoring for blood dyscrasias
should be completed every two months, especially in older
adults who may be at increased risk of toxicity.
This case of severe leflunomide toxicity in an older
adult with comorbidities illustrates the importance of
routine hematologic monitoring and the successful use of
cholestyramine to promote excretion.

70. Senior Friendly Hospital ACTION: Igniting
Collaboration Within Organizations and Across the
Province
Wendy Zeh, Ken Wong, Ada Tsang, Jesika Contreras, David
Ryan, Rhonda Schwartz, Sharon Straus, Barbara A. Liu
A five-domain Senior Friendly Hospital (SFH) Framework
guided the Ontario SFH Strategy, launched in 2011 and led by
the Regional Geriatric Program of Toronto. This framework
has provided the foundation for inquiry and priority-setting
leading to the development of a collaborative comprising
87 hospitals working together to improve hospital care with
and for older people across the province.
The hospital teams participating in the SFH ACTION
(Accelerating Change Together In Ontario) Collaborative
are engaged in a complex knowledge-to-practice (KTP)
implementation comprising training on SFH principles,
interprofessional teamwork, quality improvement methods,
and change leadership. Supported by coaching, webinars,
evaluation and feedback, the Collaborative shares success
strategies, resources and tools while implementing locally
identified improvement projects.
Guided by the Kirkpatrick learning outcomes model,
evaluation of this KTP process includes subjective ratings
of KTP events and collaborative activity; resource sharing
metrics; pre-post ratings of self-efficacy, and progress on
attaining project outcomes using the Progress Assessment
Scale (PAS).
Over 400 health care providers from 87 hospitals
participate in the Collaborative. Improvement targets
include: delirium (39% of projects), mobilization/preventing
functional decline (30%), responsive behaviours (5%), other
(26%). Interim results demonstrate high participation in
collaboration events; 26 shared tools; improvement in all 11
self-efficacy areas, and significant progress in 54 of 90 (60%)
SFH projects. The remaining projects are in the planning
(23%) and testing phases (17%). Updated evaluation results
will be presented.
This complex knowledge-to-practice process that is
focused on senior friendly care improvement projects is
unique in Ontario and possible Canada. Valuable learning
has taken place to inform sustainability and spread of senior
friendly hospitals.
The SFH ACTION Collaborative has demonstrated
improved capacity for quality improvement in participating
hospitals, as well as significant progress on organizations’
improvement goals related to senior friendly care.
Importantly, the Collaborative has also made SFH
improvement work a shared process across the province.

71. Senior Friendly Care Framework Development
Using a Modified Delphi Process

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
Jesika Contreras, David Ryan, Ken Wong, Wendy Zeh, Ada
Tsang, Rhonda Schwartz, Linda Jackson, Valerie Scarfone,
Barbara A. Liu
The healthcare needs of frail seniors involve an interplay of
medical, psychological, functional, and social dimensions.
Since 2011, the Senior Friendly Hospital framework has
successfully guided the Ontario SFH Strategy. However,
seniors require services from across the healthcare
continuum. Our objective is to evolve the SFH framework
into a Senior Friendly Care (sfCare) framework that can be
applied across all sectors of the system to improve care for
frail seniors.
We conducted a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
CINAHL and the “grey” literature for frameworks and
models of care for frail seniors in all healthcare sectors. Two
independent reviewers coded the content of the identified
articles using the original SFH domains as an a priori
framework. A third reviewer participated in the thematic
analysis, clustering of coded content and derivation of
statements to define each domain of the a priori framework.
Through a modified Delphi process, an expert panel will rate
the importance of the statements and the appropriateness of
the assigned domain.
We included 55 full papers and 23 reports from the
grey literature. The thematic analysis has led to 5 new
statements in each of organizational support, processes of
care, emotional and behavioral environment, and 1 in ethics
in clinical care and research. We have engaged 23 experts to
participate in the Delphi panel. Representation on the panel
reflects all health care sectors, urban and rural geographies,
health professions, policy makers and older persons and
family members.
The SFH framework has been effectively applied
as a holistic, organization-wide template for quality
improvement and practice change. The literature supports
the framework in its current form. Additional themes were
identified within each domain that warrant consideration
and input from an expert panel.
The successful SFH framework is evolving into a
sfCare framework using a qualitative thematic analysis of
the published and grey literature and modified Delphi panel.
The framework and preliminary consensus statements will
be presented.

72. Aerobic Training and Cerebral Autoregulation in
Older Adults at High Cardiometabolic Risk
Kenneth Madden, Darcye Cuff, Graydon Meneilly
Older adults are at high risk for syncope due to orthostatic
intolerance, and this risk increases with co-morbid Type 2
diabetes and vasoactive medications. Despite many benefits,
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

the impact of aerobic training on cerebral autoregulation
remains unclear. We examined whether aerobic training
could improve cerebral autoregulation in older adults with
Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
during upright tilting with a short-acting vasoactive agent
(nitroglycerin, GTN).
Forty older adults (25 males and 15 females, mean
age 71.4±0.7, ranging in age from 65 to 83) were recruited.
Subjects were randomized to each of 2 groups: an aerobic
group (AT, 3 months vigorous aerobic exercise), and a
nonaerobic (NA, no aerobic exercise) group. Exercise
sessions were supervised by a certified exercise trainer
3 times per week. After being given 400 micrograms of
sublingual nitroglycerin, each subject was placed in a 70
degree head-up tilt for 30 minutes. Middle Cerebral Artery
(MCA) Doppler was used to measure cerebral blood flow
during augmented tilt.
When the two groups were compared using a truncated
regression, tilt table tolerance (TTT) was significantly better
in the AT group as compared to the NA group (4.6±0.2
minutes longer in the AT group, p<.001). There was no
difference in minimum systolic, mean or diastolic MCA
velocity between the two groups.
The lack of a training effect on doppler measures of
MCA blood flow indicate that the observed improvement
in orthostatic tolerance during augmented tilt is due to
mechanisms other than changes in cerebral autoregulation.
Our findings indicate that although a relatively short
aerobic exercise intervention can successfully improve
post-GTN orthostatic tolerance in older adults with Type
2 diabetes, aerobic training has no impact on cerebral
autoregulation in older adults at high cardiometabolic
risk. Aerobic training should be considered as a potential
therapy for orthostatic intolerance in older adults on
vasoactive medications.

73. Evaluation of Geriatric Undergraduate Curriculum
at the University of Ottawa and Beyond
Jasmine Mah, Anna Byszewski, Geneviève Lemay, Glara
Gaeun Rhee, Jacinta Peel, Adam Rocker, Daniel Weiss,
Phillip Tsang
With the rapidly growing elderly population in Canada,
there is a critical need for strong geriatric foundations in
undergraduate medical education. Currently, the Canadian
Geriatrics Society (CGS) “core competencies in the care of
older persons” is a framework that guides the development
of geriatric curriculum in Canadian medical schools.
The objective of this study is to compare the
University of Ottawa’s geriatric curriculum with the
CGS core competencies, and the ultimate goal is to
draft a curriculum change. This study also compares the
227

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
University of Ottawa’s geriatric pre-clerkship curriculum
with the curricula of the other Canadian medical schools,
and reviews the undergraduate geriatric activities of these
schools using simple descriptive statistics and constant
comparative method.
The seventeen Canadian medical schools were contacted,
of which two schools did not respond to our requests, one
school had no dedicated geriatric curriculum and three others
were undergoing a similar evaluation of their geriatric content.
Broadly, the core competencies that were most consistently
met were cognitive impairment and functional assessment.
The least consistently met was adverse events. Geriatric topics
that were not covered by the CGS competences included elder
abuse, frailty and quality of life.
Our preliminary findings suggest that undergraduate
geriatric curricula are very heterogeneous in both focus and
execution. The study encountered challenges throughout the
data collection process, such as difficulties identifying key
informants within the medical schools and standardizing
metrics of geriatric curriculum.
This study illustrates which CGS competencies
are addressed, and the degree of emphasis placed on
them. Ultimately, the study will review the strengths and
weaknesses of the University of Ottawa’s pre-clerkship
geriatrics curriculum with a plan to restructure the
curriculum to better address areas of deficiency.

Chang, Norma McCormack, Susan Woollard
Chronic pain affects function, quality of life and increases
falls risk in older adults.
Objective: To assess the impact of interprofessional pain
management in the community setting.
Patients admitted to Geriatric Day Hospital (GDH) with
chronic pain (visual analogue pain – VAP scale ≥ 4) were
included. They attended this half day program twice weekly
for 8 to 10 weeks. Interprofessional team utilizes a holistic,
patient-centered approach to manage pain. Individualized
interventions include: (1) appropriate medication based on
pain etiology and comorbidities (2) monitoring treatment
adherence, efficacy and side effects (3) education on regular
analgesia administration and relaxation or distraction
strategies (4) counselling and family support (5) walking
aids and exercise routines (6) gentle manual therapies, for
example, Bowen therapy and manual lymphatic drainage
(7) linking to exercise and social programs.
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

30% of patients attended GDH from 2014 May to
2016 Aug experienced chronic pain and were included.
Average age of these 121 patients was 80 years. 62% were
female. 45% suffered pain from back, 17% from knees
and10% from shoulder. Most common etiology of pain
was osteoarthritis (48%), followed by spinal stenosis or
degenerative disc disease (25%), muscular pain (9%),
peripheral or diabetic neuropathy (7%), compression
fracture (5%) and fibromyalgia (2%). Perception of pain:
VAP scale reduced from 6.22/10 (pre) to 2.67/10 (post) and
maintained at 2.95/10 (3 mo.). Improvement in quality of life
was observed: physical score increased from (pre) 32.84 to
(post) 38.57 and 40.00 (3 mo.). Mental score increased from
(pre) 45.46 to (post) 50.97 and 51.60 (3 mo.).
Interprofessional approach was found to effectively
improve pain control and quality of life in elderly patients
in the community.
Benefits were sustained for at least 3 months.

75. Frailty in Older (>50 Years) Adults Living with
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
Jacqueline McMillan, David Hogan, John Gill, Hartmut
Krentz
An emerging concern for older HIV infected patients is
frailty. In the few studies done to date, frailty has been more
commonly identified at younger ages in individuals with HIV
when compared to non-infected individuals.
The Southern Alberta Clinic (SAC) provides centralized
HIV care to all patients in southern Alberta. SAC has
introduced annual screening for frailty on all patients >50 years
of age. Testing consists of grip strength using a dynamometer,
a timed 6-meter walk, two questions about exhaustion, and a
12-item validated questionnaire assessing physical limitations,
to determine frailty using an adaptation of the Cardiovascular
Heart Study frailty phenotype. Clinicians will also complete
the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Scale.
A third frailty measure will be the calculation of a frailty index
(FI) using standard methodology.
This study is in progress. Preliminary data on the first
18 patients, include 12 males and 6 females, with a mean
age of 73.3 years (range 50 to 87 years) and mean duration
of infection of 17.7 years (range 4 to 31 years). Seven of 18
clients score ≥4 on the Clinical Frailty Scale suggesting
the presence of frailty (41%). Eight of 18 clients have grip
strength measurements at or below the 5th percentile. Five
of 18 clients have slow walking speed and one-third report
frequent exhaustion.
These results are preliminary. There are 688 clients
who are over the age of 50 years. Early analysis of the data
suggests that this is a vulnerable group who are at risk
medically, functionally and socially.

Potential long-term implications of this research project
range from better care of aging PLWHA to improved

76. Increasing Research Value with Sex-Specific
Reporting of Data: the Cholinesterase Inhibitor Example
Nishila Mehta, Craig Rodrigues, Manpreet Lamba, Wei Wu,
Susan Bronskill, Nathan Herrmann, Sudeep Gill, An Wen
Chan, Robin Mason, Suzanne Day, Paula Rochon
Drug trials routinely collect data on age and sex, yet seldom
report results separately by sex, and thus cannot inform our
understanding of differences between women and men on the
benefits and harms of drug therapy. Consequently, valuable,
readily available data are wasted, resulting in a missed
opportunity to increase research value. We aimed to quantify
this data gap through examining drug trials of cholinesterase
inhibitor (ChEI) therapies for dementia, a condition that
increases with age and disproportionately affects women.
A systematic review was performed of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) of oral formulations of cholinesterase
inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigimine or galantamine) with
clinical outcomes, identified from electronic searches of
databases. Sex-specific data were extracted from eight
sections of each article (i.e. methods. results, etc.). For
donepezil trials, the most widely used ChEI, detailed data
on adverse events were obtained.
In all, 33 RCTs were evaluated, in which 57% of total
participants were women and the weighted average age
of participants was 74.1 years. These trials were highly
cited and published in high impact journals. In the title,
introduction, limitations and conclusion sections, no article
mentioned sex. In the abstract section, 3 (9%) articles
mentioned sex (all as a demographic characteristic). In the
methods section, 6 (18%) articles mentioned sex. For the
results section, almost all 32 (97%) trials mentioned sex
(all as a demographic characteristic in a table). Among the
donepezil trials, no trial provided sex-specific reporting of
adverse events.
Through this analysis, we see that there is an almost
complete lack of sex-specific reporting of data in clinical
trials for dementia drug therapies.
Sex-specific reporting of data should be required in all
trials to increase research value.

77. Impact of Side Effects on Adherence to
Antidepressants Among Older Adults Covered by a
Public Drug Insurance Plan in Quebec
Raymond Milan, Helen-Maria Vasiliadis, Djamal Berbich
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

Canada has recently seen an increase in the geriatric
population. Similarly, the use of new generation
antidepressants, for psychiatric and non-psychiatric
indications, in this population followed this same trend.
However, between 44% and 52% of patients discontinued
their medication after 3 months. The occurrence of side
effects is an important factor related to non-adherence
to antidepressants. Studies that evaluated the impact of
side effects on antidepressant usage included adults aged
18 years and older. No study so far has been carried out
in Canada using only patients aged 65 years or older and
covered by public drug insurance plan in Quebec.
Data used in this study came from the ESA-Services
study, conducted in 2011-2016 using a large sample of older
adults (n=1811) aged 65 years or older waiting for medical
services in primary health clinics in one of the health regions
of Quebec. Side effects associated with antidepressants
were self-reported using an adapted questionnaire based
on the Patient rated inventory side effect list and the
FIBSER scale. Medication adherence was measured using
the medication possession ratio over 6 and 12 months.
Adherence was also self-reported using the 8-item Morisky
Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) over a 6-month
period. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to model
medication adherence as a function of study variables.
There is a differential association between side effects
and adherence to antidepressants depending on gender and
psychiatric diagnosis.
First study in Canada to identify side effects that
influence adherence to antidepressants among older adults
covered by public drug insurance in Quebec.
This study will identify vulnerable people in order
to reduce relapse and chronicity of the conditions that an
antidepressant was prescribed for.

78. A Driving Cessation Decision-Making and Coping
Framework and Toolkit for People with Dementia

Polgar, Mark  J.   Rapoport, on Behalf of the Canadian
Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging Driving and
Dementia Team
Drivers with dementia and their families inevitably face
the need to make decisions about driving, and driving
retirement marks a major life transition associated with
many negative health and social implications. This research
aims to address gaps in support for driving cessation for
persons with dementia and their caregivers.
We conducted a range of research activities to
develop an evidence-informed framework to organize
driving cessation interventions. These activities include
229

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
systematic reviews on topics related to driving cessation
and a qualitative study to explore the perspectives of key
informants on strategies to support decision-making and the
transition to non-driving. We completed a meta-synthesis of
findings to identify the important elements for inclusion in a
driving cessation intervention. Existing tools and resources
on driving cessation were also collected, reviewed and
organized according to the thematic areas.
Based on the results from the meta-synthesis, we have
developed a framework to organize interventions according
to different content areas (e.g., education and awareness,
grief and loss, and community access) that depict the various
needs of drivers and former drivers with dementia, and
their caregivers, along with corresponding tools to address
these. We identified the need to balance practical, problembased responses with those that address the emotional and
meaning-oriented effects of driving cessation in the context
of dementia.
The driving cessation framework and toolkit offers an
approach that addresses and integrates a range of practical
and emotional needs specific to persons with dementia and
their caregivers.
The driving cessation and decision-making and coping
framework and toolkit will increase the accessibility of
available resources, and has the potential to enhance the
safety, quality of life and social inclusion of individuals
with dementia and their caregivers.

79. Elder Abuse Interventions
Communities—a Systematic Review

in

Immigrant

Syed Naqvi, Ryhana Dawood, Raza Naqvi
Researchers project that by 2030 a third of the Canadian
population will be 60 years old or above. Currently Canadian
immigrants make up a significant proportion of the senior
population. Given that the median age is higher for immigrants
than the native born population, we can expect that first
generation and immigrant senior populations will continue
to grow. For all seniors, however, regardless of cultural
background, elder abuse is a serious issue that is not easily
identified in clinical settings. Furthermore, we know little
about how to effectively combat elder abuse especially among
immigrants as there may be several unique factors such as
cultural norms, financial dependency on children, extended
family structures, etc. This study will carry out a systematic
review regarding interventions that have been used to combat
elder abuse in immigrant communities across the world.
A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the
Cochrane Library will be conducted. Criteria regarding
eligible studies will be established. Two independent
reviewers will review the abstracts based on the eligibility
criteria. Full-text review will be carried out for relevant
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

studies and data will be extracted in a systematic manner.
The results are pending and will be available for the
2017 ASM.
This study seeks to collate and analyze interventions
that target elder abuse in immigrant communities across the
world. This may help shed light on whether more research
is needed and which interventions work best for specific
immigrant communities.
The results of this review will help Canadian healthcare
professionals and policy makers understand the interventions
targeting elder abuse in immigrants that have been carried
out and help guide the development of practices best suited
for the diverse Canadian senior immigrant population.

80. Accelerometry and Godin Leisure-Time
Questionnaire Relationship in Men on ADT for
Prostate Cancer
Meagan  O’Neill, Daniel Santa Mina, Catherine Sabiston,
George Tomlinson, Shabbir M. H. Alibhai
Prostate cancer (PC) is the most commonly diagnosed
cancer in North American men. Research has shown
physical activity (PA) improves multiple side effects which
men with PC can experience. However, most men with
PC do not meet the recommended PA levels. Accurately
assessing PA levels allows for proper reporting and
prescription. Accelerometry (AC) and the Godin-Shephard
Leisure-Time PA (Godin) Questionnaire evaluate PA and
moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). While AC is considered
the gold standard, Godin is a one-page, easy to administer
questionnaire. There has been no study assessing the
agreement between the two measures.
Godin and AC measures were taken as part of an
exercise trial for older men on Androgen Deprivation
Therapy for PC. Measures were taken at each assessment,
once every 3 months for 1 year and participants completed
a Godin questionnaire and wore an AC for one week.
Statistical analyses included comparing median MVPA
minutes and Spearman’s correlation coefficient.
We analyzed a total of 130 time points. Participants’
mean age was 70 years old, they were mostly Caucasian
(71%), married (69%), and retired (64%). The median
amount of time in MVPA from the Godin was 60 minutes,
compared to the AC at 106.5 minutes. The number of time
points found meeting MVPA criteria were 38 from Godin
and 44 from AC. Spearman’s correlation between the Godin
and AC was poor at 0.133, and the concordance correlation
coefficient was also poor at 0.147.
Our preliminary analysis suggests a weak correlation
and agreement between the two measures. The Godin
appears to underreport PA compared to the AC, which may
be due to definitions of MVPA.

Further analysis with a larger sample size and robust
endpoints should be completed.

81. Administration of Intravenous Therapy in LongTerm Care: Caregiver and Key Stakeholder Perspectives
Alexandra  Papaioannou, Denis O’Donnell, George
Ioannidis, Afeez A. Hazzan, Hrishi Navare, Daphne
Broadhurst, Loretta M. Hillier, Diane Simpson, Mark Loeb
In Ontario, intravenous (IV) therapy is typically not
available in long-term care (LTC), requiring residents to
receive this in hospital. The purpose of this study was to
obtain key stakeholder perceptions of the administration
of IV therapy for antibiotic treatment of infections and
hydration within LTC homes to avoid hospital transfers and
facilitate early discharge from hospital.
An IV therapy service was pilot-tested over nine months
in four LTC homes in the Hamilton-Niagara region. A number
of resources were developed to facilitate implementation
including clinical pathways for infections, pharmacist and
nurse practitioner-led triage support and nursing services
to provide just-in-time training. Interviews were conducted
with six caregivers of residents who received IV therapy and
ten key stakeholders representing LTC home staff and service
partners to assess their perceptions of the service. A chart
review was conducted to describe service implementation.
Twelve residents received IV therapy, nine for
hydration and three for antibiotic treatment. This service
potentially avoided nine emergency department visits and
reduced hospital lengths of stay for three residents whose
IV therapy was initiated in hospital. There were no adverse
events. The service was well received by caregivers and key
stakeholders as it was provided in a familiar environment
with familiar care providers, was considered less stressful
for residents and caregivers and was perceived as better
quality care than care in-hospital. All key stakeholders were
in favor of widespread implementation.
IV therapy is feasible to implement in LTC homes when
there are educational, nursing and pharmacy supports as
well as clinical pathways to support decision-making.
This service increases LTC home capacity to provide
medical treatment and potentially improves health outcomes
and quality of life.

82. Impact of Comorbidity Among Older Adults Living
in North West LHIN Admitted for Medical Issues
Alexandrea Peel, Iris Gutmanis, Trevor Bon
This study assessed the impact of comorbidity on mortality
and morbidity among older adults in the North West
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

Local Health Integration Network (NW LHIN), where
hospitalization rates for many chronic health issues exceeds
that for Ontario.
This retrospective cohort study examined healthcare
utilization among community-dwelling older adults
(aged 65 or more) who were admitted to a medical service
at the Thunder Bay Regional Health Science Centre
(TBRHSC) between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2013.
Survival and logistic regression were used to determine
the impact of comorbidity, as measured by the Charlson
Comorbidity Index, on in-hospital and 1-year mortality
as well as 1-year readmission rates in the year following
index admission discharge.
During the 10 study years, 12,033 people (47.1% male,
aged 65-103 years) were admitted to TBRHSC (97.9%
lived in the LHIN; 21.0% were transfers to TBRHSC;
6.5% in-hospital mortality). At index admission, 32.9%
had COPD, 20.9% had cancer, and 17.9% had congestive
heart failure. Further, 36.4% had no comorbidities while
21.2% had three or more. Odds of in-hospital mortality
increased by number of comorbidities (2.5 (0 vs.1
comorbidity) vs. 3.1 (0 vs. 2) vs. 7.1 (0 vs. 3+). The hazard
ratio associated with 1-year mortality increased from 1.6
(0 vs. 1) to 5.5 (0 vs. 3+). The hazard ratio associated with
1-year readmission increased from 1.2 (0 vs. 1) to 1.7 (0
vs. 3+).
Older adults with multiple comorbidities have a higher
risk of mortality, especially during acute episodes that
require hospital admission, perhaps due to care siloed by
disease categories.
Older NW LHIN residents, especially those admitted
to acute care with three or more comorbidities, require
regionally coordinated, comprehensive assessment and care
for all concurrent health issues.

83. Prognostic Significance of a Prolonged International
Normalized Ratio in Elderly Patients in an Internal
Medicine Ward
Galina Plotnikov, Oleg Gorelic, Lior Bracha, Moshe Tishler,
Shimon Izhakian
To investigate clinical characteristics and the prognostic
significance of a prolonged international normalized ratio
(INR) without obvious cause or anticoagulant treatment, in
elderly inpatients.
Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, in-hospital
death and 30 day-mortality were prospectively registered
for 100 consecutive patients aged ≥ 75 years admitted to
an internal medicine ward for a variety of acute medical
disorders, and compared according to normal (≤1.15) and
prolonged (>1.15) INR on admission. Exclusion criteria
were: anticoagulant therapy, disseminated intravascular
231

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
coagulopathy, acute bleeding, liver disease, active malignant
disorder, and known coagulopathy.
Prolonged INR was found in 52% of patients. Patients
with prolonged INR tended more likely to present with
dementia and pressure sores than patients with normal INR.
Moreover, patients with prolonged INR more often needed
assisted feeding and presented lower mean levels of serum
albumin on admission. In-hospital (21.2% vs. 6.2%) and
30-day (32.7% vs. 6.2%) mortality rates were significantly
higher in patients with prolonged INRs . On stepwise logistic
regression analysis, prolonged INR strongly predicted 30day mortality (p = .004, relative risk 1.67, 95% confidence
interval 1.07–2.60).
The main novelty of the present study is the
demonstration of clinical significance of prolonged INR
without obvious cause or anticoagulant treatment.Increased
mortality may be related to a more severe clinical profile
and poor nutrition, particularly for nutritional deficiency
of vitamin K, resulting in diminished host defense and
systemic recovery.
Prolonged INR without obvious cause is common
among elderly patients admitted to an internal medicine
ward, and is associated with a severe clinical profile.
Prolonged INR is a powerful predictor of 30-day mortality.
Assessment of INR my improve risk stratification for
elderly inpatients.

84. A Qualitative Systematic Review of the Healthcare
Experiences of Persons with Dementia and Their
Caregivers in Primary and Secondary Care
Jeanette Prorok, Colleen McMillan, Mark Oremus, Paul Stolee
While research interest in healthcare experiences has grown,
to date no measure of experience for persons with dementia
and their caregivers has been developed. Phase 1 (qualitative
systematic review and thematic synthesis) results of a threephase study to develop such a measure are presented.
The MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO electronic
databases were searched to identify relevant articles.
Records were screened in duplicate. Study characteristics,
methodologies, and results were abstracted from the
included studies. A thematic synthesis was undertaken. A
healthcare experiences framework was developed to guide
the development of measure domains.
The titles and abstracts of 2911 unique citations were
screened in duplicate. 254 records underwent full-text
review. 87 articles met inclusion criteria. Agreement was
found to be very good between screeners, with Kappas of
0.837 and 0.847 for the title/abstract and full-text screening
respectively. An additional four articles were included
through hand searching, resulting in a final number of
91 included articles. Thematic synthesis generated 11
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

descriptive themes which included relationships with
healthcare providers, coordination of care, supports and
services, role and identity, and communication, among
others. The analytical themes derived from these themes
formed the basis of the framework.
The next phase of the study will seek input from
persons with dementia and caregivers on Phase 1 results,
including the framework, measure domains, and aspects of
the measure itself such as the items, readability, and other
feedback. Psychometric testing of the developed and refined
measure will occur in Phase 3.
This review supports development of a multidimensional
measure of health care experience for persons with dementia
and their caregivers.

85. Exploring the Geriatric Needs of Oncology Inpatients
at an Academic Cancer Centre
Carla Rosario, Martine Puts, Raymond Jang, Andrea
Bezjak, Daniel Yokom, Shabbir M.H. Alibhai
Geriatric Assessments (“GAs”) in older adults with
cancer have informed treatment decision-making and
refined survival prediction. However in geriatric oncology
literature little is known about the geriatric needs of older
inpatients with cancer. Our Objectives included: (1) to test
the feasibility of a bedside GA for older cancer inpatients,
and (2) to determine the prevalence of impairments in
geriatric domains in older adult inpatients with cancer.
Cross-sectional observational single-centre pilot study.
Structured GAs were performed on patients admitted
to inpatient wards at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.
Eligible patients were age 65+, cancer diagnosis of any
stage, English-speaking, and admitted to a medical or
radiation oncology ward. We used a validated questionnaire
to examine the needs of older patients by assessing typical
domains of the GA. The summary of GA findings was
shared with the patient’s most responsible physician.
23 patients have been approached and 21 were enrolled
(recruitment rate 91%). Completion of the GA was possible in
95% of patients (20/21). Average time to complete the assessment
was 35 mins. The mean number of geriatric domains impaired
per patient was 4, with polypharmacy (18/20), mood (15/20) and
increased falls risk (15/20) being the most common abnormal
domains. Attending physicians responded to our survey for 10
of 20 participants (50% response rate), and 7 of 10 indicated
that the results of the GA provided helpful information for the
management of their patients.
Abnormal geriatric domains are commonly detected,
and bringing those abnormal domains to the attention of the
attending physicians may be helpful in the management of
older cancer patients.

A structured GA is feasible in older inpatients with
cancer and will aid to deliver comprehensive care to
Geriatrics Oncology patients.

86. Validating the Clinical Frailty Scale and Exploring
Pre-Frailty in Community-Dwelling Older Adults with
Pre-Clinical Disability
Gabriela Rozanski, Ada Tang, Gabriela Rozanski, Julie
Gourlay, Kelsey Jack, Christina Nowak
Pre-frailty and pre-clinical disability are both transitional
states of declining physical function, but there is a lack
of understanding about how measures of these constructs
relate. One assessment tool with high potential for
practicability, the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), has not been
fully validated. Thus, the objectives were to 1) determine the
frailty status of older adults with pre-clinical disability; and
2) examine the construct validity of the CFS in identifying
individuals who are pre-frail.
Thirty-one community-dwelling older adults (age 71.9
± 8.0 years, 52% male) with pre-clinical disability were
assessed using the CFS and the established Fried’s Frailty
Phenotype (FFP). Physical performance measures (SixMinute Walk Test, grip strength, knee extensor strength,
Four-meter Walk Test for gait speed, Five Times Sit to
Stand test) were administered and considered as possible
correlates with the CFS and FFP.
Twenty-three (74%) participants were classified as prefrail according to FFP. There was no difference in CFS
scores between individuals identified as robust and pre-frail
by FFP (median 2.5 and 3.5, respectively; p=.91) and the
CFS did not correlate with any of the physical performance
measures (|ρ|=0.02-0.30). FFP scores correlated with gait
speed (ρ=-0.51, p=.007).
Our findings suggest that pre-clinical disability and
pre-frailty are not mutually exclusive constructs. CFS
scores did not discriminate between robust and pre-frail
participants; rather, based on its correlation with FFP, gait
speed may be a useful screening tool for stages of frailty.
The use of the CFS to identify individuals who are
pre-frail is not supported by the current study. Further
research is warranted to investigate the relationship
between pre-clinical disability and pre-frailty as well as
to explore clinically-feasible methods of detecting these
vulnerable states.

87. How Do Falls Impact Cancer Treatment in Older
Cancer Patients?
Schroder Sattar, Shabbir M. H. Alibhai, Sandra Spoelstra,
Martine Puts
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

Little is known about the circumstances of falls, how
falls are assessed in oncology clinics, and the impact of
falls on cancer treatment in older cancer patients. The
purpose of this study is to address these important gaps
in geriatric oncology.
This is an embedded mixed-methods cross-sectional
study. We are recruiting 100 community-dwelling older
cancer patients at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto,
Ontario who have experienced ≥ one fall within the past 12
months. Methods of data collection include self-reported
survey supplemented by chart review and oncologist survey.
To date, 35 older cancer patients have participated.
The median age is 78 (range 66-92). Thirty (86%) are male.
Five participants (14%) live alone. Twenty-three (66%)
have ≥ one functional limitation. Nineteen (54%) use a
walking aid. Eight (23%) have peripheral neuropathies.
The most common cancer diagnoses are prostate and
hematological cancers. Eighteen(51%) have experienced
more than one fall. The injurious fall rate is 54%. Injuries
reported include bruise, abrasion, bleeding, broken nose/
tooth, and rib/ hip fractures. The most common locations
of falls are staircase, sidewalk curb, and washroom. So far,
no impact on cancer treatment by falls has been identified
by either patients or oncologists. Half the participants did
not report their falls to their oncologists; of those who did,
few were assessed. Nearly half of the participants express
high concerns about falling.
Falls are uncommonly reported by older cancer patients
to their oncologists, are rarely assessed by oncologists, and
do not affect cancer treatment.
More work needs to be done to assess whether cancer
treatments are associated with falls risk.

88. The Canadian Frailty Priority Setting Partnership
Jennifer Bethell, Schroder Sattar, Martine Puts, Melissa
Andrew, Ana Patricia Ayala, Jenny Ploeg, Carlo Deangelis,
Jacobi Elliott, Chris Frank, Souraya Sidani, Katherine
McGilton
Guided by the principles of active engagement of key
stakeholders in the process of priority setting, the objective
of the Canadian Frailty Priority-setting Partnership (PSP)
is to identify the “top ten” frailty research priorities by
consensus of Canadians living with frailty, their caregivers,
health and social care providers and the public.
The Canadian Frailty PSP follows the James Lind
Alliance (JLA – a non-profit initiative of the UK National
Institute for Health Research and Medical Research
Council) method—which includes setting up a priority—
setting partnership, gathering uncertainties, data
processing, interim and final prioritizing, disseminating
and publishing the “top ten” priorities, taking the priorities
233

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
to researcher funders, and follow up. This project is
overseen by a Steering Group which includes frail older
adults, caregivers, and medical and social care providers
in consultation with the JLA.
We developed a questionnaire based on the template of the
JLA. The questionnaire has been translated from English to
French and is being circulated across Canada in collaboration
with the Canadian Frailty Network, health professional and
social care organizations, as well as national, provincial and
local charities and senior organizations, seeking to engage a
broad representation of people who encounter frailty.
Next steps: The research questions generated by this
questionnaire will continue to be refined, systematically
checked against current research evidence, and then
prioritized through a two-stage process, which includes an
interim prioritization for short-listing and then a face-toface meeting in the form of group discussions and plenary
sessions to reach the final ten prioritized uncertainties.
This project will develop the top 10 Canadian Frailty
research priorities to help improve care and quality of life of
those living with frailty.

89. Improved Constipation Assessment and Interventions
in the Elderly
Sheena Schuck, Karen Truter, Kayleen Peters
Constipation is a frequent health concern for elderly
persons and their care providers. Constipation is associated
with increased incidence of delirium, urinary and fecal
incontinence, depression and a decreased overall health
quality of life. Few resources however, are available to
health care providers to guide them in an evidence-based
approach to this common problem. A significant event
leading to negative patient outcomes caused by a lack of
timely assessment and response was a catalyst to re-evaluate
the Geriatric Inpatient Rehabilitation Unit’s approach to
constipation management.
Objective: Can the use of a constipation management
guideline and staff education decrease constipation in the
elderly on a Geriatric Inpatient Rehabilitation Unit?
Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) quality improvement
methodology was used.

A Constipation Management Guideline was developed.
A validated assessment tool “The Bristol Stool chart”
was introduced.
Multimodal staff education was provided.

CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

•	

Chart audits, patient and staff satisfaction surveys
evaluated constipation assessment, intervention and
patient satisfaction with constipation care.

1.	 Staff assessment, intervention and documentation of
constipation improved.
2.	 Fewer patients were constipated.
3.	 Patients felt that their constipation was treated and they
“felt better,” however, opportunities were identified to
better support the patient’s “experience” with constipation.
4.	 100% of staff surveyed identified that the constipation
guidelines were meaningful to their practice.
Nurses’ understanding of the adverse outcomes of
constipation as well as their values and beliefs towards
patients’ experience with constipation can affect their
perceived value of the constipation guideline and subsequent
interventions utilized.
Constipation guidelines can improve staff assessment
and intervention for patients’ with constipation on a
Geriatric Rehabilitation Unit.

90. Advanced Directives in Medical Aid in Dying: a
Survey of Canadian Geriatricians and Care Providers
Emma Scotchmer, Raza Naqvi
Bill C-14 recently passed in Canada, allowing adults who are
capable and have a grievous, irremediable condition to have
medical aid in dying (MAID). The law stipulates patients
must be capable at the time of making the decision and when
they receive assisted dying. Therefore, creating an advanced
directive for MAID is currently illegal. However, in some
European countries, e.g. Netherlands, advanced directives for
MAID are permitted for people who will become incapable,
such as people with dementia. This survey’s purpose was to
probe deeper into this ethical topic and obtain perspectives of
clinicians who may have to consider these issues in the future.
An online survey was distributed to geriatricians, medical
students, and other physician groups. There were 15 quantitative
questions, 2 cases and an optional comments section. Results
were compiled and reviewed by two independent reviewers.
There were 72 survey respondents; the majority were
geriatricians (43.7%), medical learners (35.3%) and internal
medicine specialists (12.7%). The survey demonstrated
conflicting results between clinicians about whether they
would be able to assist someone with dementia with an
advanced directive for MAID.
There were many ethical and personal issues that
clinicians raised under different circumstances. Of note,
several clinicians would want MAID themselves if they had
dementia, but were hesitant to provide it for a patient. Another
important topic that clinicians presented in this survey was the
need for accessible palliative care for patients with dementia.
234

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
This survey showed a need for better education for
physicians and families on how to discuss end of life care
appropriately with the different available choices, the
complexities of their decisions in the future and the emotional
challenges that will be faced.

91. Association Between the Motoric Cognitive Risk
Syndrome and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in the
European Population; Result from a Cross-Sectional
Study
Harmehr Sekhon, Cyrille Launay, Gilles Allali, Julia
Chabot, Olivier Beauchet
Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome is a new clinical
syndrome, which precedes dementia. MCR syndrome is
in particular a strong predictor of vascular dementia. Few
have examined the association between cardiovascular risk
factor and motoric cognitive risk syndrome. Significant
associations have been reported in the American and
Japanese populations. There is no information in the
European population. The objective of this study was
to examine the association of the MCR syndrome with
cardiovascular risk factors the European population.
A total of 238, individuals were recruited in this cross
sectional study. The prevalence of MCR was 16.8 (n=40).
Diabetes, waist hip ratio, cardiovascular diseases, body mass
index, waist hip ratio and hypertension were cardiovascular risk
factor examined measured. Age, sex and number of therapeutic
classes taken daily have been used as covariates.
The MCR syndrome was associated with a number
of therapeutic classes taken daily (p=.010), high value of
body mass index (p<.001) and waist hip ratio (p<.015), high
blood pressure (p=.018) and diabetes (p=.009). Multiple
logistic regressions showed that there is a strong association
between MCR syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors
for high blood pressure (2.85 [1.19;6.81]) and for abnormal
waist hip ratio (2.51 [1.13;5.60]).
The findings show that MCR syndrome is associated
with multi morbidities and cardiovascular risk factors.
Moreover, in the European population MCR syndrome is
associated with hypertension and abnormal waist to hip ratio.
The MCR syndrome was associated with cardiovascular
risk factors in the European population.

92. Characteristics of Caregiver Burden in the Canadian
Longitudinal Study on Aging
Emily Skrastins, Yoko Ishigami, Susan Kirkland
The Canadian senior population is expected to double over
the next two decades, which will result in an increasing
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

need for aging-related caregiving. Informal caregivers
can relieve pressure on the formal care system, but high
caregiver burden may lead to negative outcomes for both the
caregivers and the recipients. Our objective is to describe
the existing caregiving burden in Canada by presenting
demographics, patterns and associated factors among
current caregivers and receivers.
We used baseline Tracking data from the Canadian
Longitudinal Study on Aging, which has a representative
sample of more than 20,000 participants between the ages of
45 and 85. Descriptive statistics using proportions and means
were calculated and stratified according to age and sex.
Informal caregiving is common in Canada. In the
CLSA, 46.7% percent of participants providing assistance
to another individual and 15.7% receiving care themselves.
Caregivers tended to be younger and female. Younger
caregivers (45-64 years) were more likely to care for a
parent, while older caregivers (65-85 years) were more likely
to care for a spouse or friend. The majority of caregivers
provided less than 20 hours per week of care, but those who
provided more had a higher prevalence of low satisfaction
with life (16%), depressive symptoms (18.9%), and low selfrated physical health (15.1%).
These initial results give insight into current caregiving
patterns and factors associated with higher burden.
The next steps of this study will include statistical
testing and comparison of results between Nova Scotia and
Canada to better understand caregiver burden according to
social and environmental factors.

93. Hypertension and Disability in Tunisian’s Elderly
Sonia Hammami, Amel Barhoumi, Said Hajem, Mohamed
Hammami
Hypertension is another common condition in older subjects,
representing the most common morbid condition after
osteoarthritis (Psaty et al., 2001). Hypertension represents
a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the major
source of morbidity among the over 65 population (ISTAT,
2005). In such a context, the aims of the present study
were to investigate whether hypertension was associated
independently with physical disability.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted, covering a
sample of 598 subjects (202 male , 396 female, mean aged
72,3 years) aged 65 years and over. The study approved
by ethics Committee and supported by OMS and FNUAP.
Information was gathered by home-based personal
interview using a structured questionnaire. We assessed
their disability status, sociodemographic informations and
health behaviours. Disability was recorded on three levels
scale : (intense, moderate and no disability) Statistical
analysis was performed with SPSS and the significance was
235

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
accepted at the p < .05 level. Multiple logistic regression
models were used to obtain the independent variables
associated with hypertension
The prevalence of hypertension was 52 % (n=311),
more frequent for female population (55 % vs. 45 % for
male). The prevalence of disability was 34.6 %, only 10
% have intense disability. Those with hypertension had
higher Body Mass Index, waist circumference and diabetes.
Regarding disability, the individuals who presented the
highest prevalence of hypertension were more dependent.
Multiple logistic regression revealed that the following
were significantly independent factors of hypertension :
Disability (OR = 1.6). Diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.36]).and a
higher BMI (OR = 2.36).
Hypertension is associated not only to cardiovascular
factors (Diabetes obesity) but also with higher functional
disability.
Older subjects are exposed at significantly higher
likelihood of physical disability. Public health strategies to
prevention hypertension in elderly may protect them also
against disability.

94. Multimorbidity in Community-Living Canadians
Philip St. John, Suzanne Tyas, Verena Menec, Tate Robert,
Griffith Lauren
Diseases co-occur and this co-occurrence carries a high
risk of death and health care utilization. It also complicates
clinical care, since it can lead to polypharmacy. There are
studies of multimorbidity in clinical settings, and studies
using administrative data. However, there are fewer
population-based epidemiological studies of multimorbidity.
In the population-based Canadian Longitudinal Study
of Aging (n=21 235), diseases were self-reported from a list
of conditions. We considered 31 chronic diseases and risk
factors which were not mental health conditions or acute in
nature. We summed the number of these chronic diseases.
We then standardized the mean number of chronic health
problems to the Canadian population of 2011.
Multimorbidity was very common, and the mean
number of chronic illnesses standardized to the Canadian
population was 3.1. Women had a higher number of chronic
illnesses than men in most age groups. The number of
chronic conditions was strongly associated with age: The
mean number of conditions was 2.1 in those age 45 - 54;
2.9 in those 55 - 64; 3.8 in those age 65 - 74 and 4.8 in those
age 75+.
Multimorbidity is common in the Canadian population,
and strongly age-related.
Since most Canadians would meet the definition of
multimorbidity according to the current cut point of 3+
diseases, this definition may need to be reconsidered.

95. Trends in the Management of Type 2 Diabetes in a Short
Term Geriatric Unit in Sherbrooke from 2005 to 2015.
Annette Thébeau, Daniel Tessier, Lise Trottier
Type 2 diabetes is a growing epidemic, and its prevalence
increases with age. Older individuals are at greater risk of
suffering side effects from the pharmacological treatment.
The biggest concern in this population is hypoglycaemia
which can have dire consequences, including falls, cognitive
or functional decline and even death.
This quality act retrospective transversal study was
realized at the short term geriatric unit in Sherbrooke.
We looked at the tendency in prescriptions regarding
hypoglycemic agents and insulin, glycated haemoglobin
values and rate of hypoglycaemia episodes in patients with
type 2 diabetes hospitalized in 2005, 2010 and 2015.
We looked at 100, 83 and 94 charts for the years 2005,
2010 and 2015, respectively. The mean hospitalization length
was around 25 days. We noticed an increase in prescriptions
of metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors over time (p<.05),
and a decrease in prescriptions of thiazolidinediones and
sulfonylureas. The mean glycated haemoglobin value
increased from 6.48 in 2005 to 6.72 in 2010 and 7.15 in
2015 (p<.05). The rate of hypoglycemic event (glucose
value < 4) followed a reverse tendency, falling from 46% in
2005 to 32.5% in 2010 and 13.8% in 2015 (p<.05). Severe
hypoglycemic events (glucose value < 2) and repeat events
were also significantly reduced over this period.
Our study demonstrates a change in drug prescription
tendency for type 2 diabetes between 2005 and 2015. We
think that this practice, along with higher target glycated
haemoglobin, explains the reduction in hypoglycemic events.
These findings are in agreement of the Canadian
Diabetes Guidelines, which suggest adapted glycated
haemoglobin targets in frail elderly patients and also,
choosing drugs with a lower incidence of hypoglycemia.

96. Improving End-of-Life Management in Long-Term
Care (LTC) Homes Through Education Across Canada:

Most LTC residents would benefit from a PalCare approach
and approximately 20-30% of residents die per year.
However, studies show gaps exist in PalCare education of
LTC staff. Pallium Canada (www.pallium.ca), a non-profit
236

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
organization has developed continuing interprofessional
palliative care education since 2001. Its Learning Essential
Approaches to Palliative Care (LEAP) LTC course was
launched in June 2015.
Pallium Canada’s LEAP LTC is a 2-day interprofessional
course that provides essential palliative and end-of-life skills
to physicians, nurses, personal support workers (PSW),
pharmacists, aids and other healthcare staff. The course goals
are to a) improve skills related to palliative care; b) promote
interprofessional collaboration; c) link LTC homes with local
PalCare teams; and d) catalyze Quality Improvement (QI)
initiatives in this area. Evaluation of the courses currently
consists of a pre- versus post-course evaluation of changes
in knowledge, attitudes and comfort levels as well as a postcourse commitment to change reflection.
From June 2015 to December 2016, 27 LEAP LTC courses
were held in 18 communities across Alberta, Ontario, Nova
Scotia and British Columbia, with total of 559 participants:
43 physicians, 283 nurses, 87 PSWs and aids, and 146 other
professionals. 56 certified LEAP LTC Facilitators delivered
the courses. 96% of participants recommend the course to
their colleagues. Changes in knowledge, attitudes, comfortlevels and commitment to change will be presented (they
show significant improvement).
Demand for the course is growing across Canada.
Early results show significant improvements in
participants’ skills and change in care. The next steps are to
spread the program further and to leverage it as a QI catalyst.

97. TELEPROM-G: a Pilot Study Utilizing an Innovative
Technological Solution to Enhancing the Care of
Community-Based Seniors Experiencing Depressive
Symptoms
Akshya Vasudev, Cheryl Forchuk, Amer Burhan, Richard
Booth, Jeff Hoch, Wanrudee Isaranuwatchai, Abraham
Rudnick, Puneet Seth, Alistair Flint, Soham Rej, Jeffrey Reiss
Current models of healthcare delivery do not adequately
meet the needs of the increasing number of older Canadian
adults; depression is a particularly pervasive and complex
issue. Mobile technology may offer an innovative and
effective method of providing timely healthcare support,
improving accessibility to care and addressing the complex
needs of seniors. However, research on the implementation
of this technology is limited.
The primary objectives of this pilot study were to:
examine the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a
mobile-based health care client health record (CHR) and
determine what further modifications to enhance the CHR
would be necessary.
30 adults (aged 65 or older) with depressive symptoms
and living in the community were issued with chromebook

tablets. A one year pilot, completed April 2017, evaluated
the use of a secure cloud-based TELEmedicine and PatientReported Outcome Measurement (PROM) platform
(TELEPROM-G), developed by InputHealth solutions. This
platform has the ability for healthcare providers to track
patient-reported health outcomes and to video-conference
with their clients.
A mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) design
was used to assess the feasibility of implementing the CHR;
i.e. individual interviews and focus groups with clients,
focus groups with HCPs.
Findings from interviews and focus groups with
participants will be discussed.
Findings from interviews and focus groups with
participants will be discussed.
The pilot study assessed the feasibility of using this
technology with the senior population, and to identify and
correct implementation issues before wider-scale adoption
of the technology. This pilot study has provided information
to enhance the technology in readiness for larger cohort
studies across multiple sites in Canada and the U.K.

98. When Less May Be More: Discontinuing Docusate
from a Standardized Hospital Order Set
Maia Von Maltzahn, Camilla Wong, Rosa Maria Tanzini
Findings from a systematic review conducted by the
Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health
(CADTH) indicate that docusate does not prevent or
improve symptoms of constipation in hospital, yet docusate
remains available on many hospital admission order sets.
Consequences for the health care system and patients
are manifold, with potential for increased health care
delivery costs, inappropriate prescribing, and delays in
the appropriate management of constipation. For elderly
patients vulnerable to constipation and the adverse effects
of inappropriate prescribing, this is a significant concern.
As part of a quality improvement initiative, on
January 1, 2016, St. Michael’s Hospital removed docusate
from admission order sets for oncology ward inpatients.
Unit order sets retained evidence-based alternatives for
constipation management and prevention. A one-year pre/
post cohort study was designed to determine the impact
of this initiative. Primary outcomes include incident
constipation, and constipation management strategies.
To date, 169 charts have been reviewed: 142 preintervention and 27 post-intervention, up until June 2016.
The use of docusate has dropped dramatically, from 69
prescriptions (49% of patients) before intervention, to 2
(7% of patients) after removal from the standardized order
set. Lactulose use remained consistent, while sennoside
and polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) use have both slightly
237

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
increased. Among patients aged sixty-five and older,
docusate use decreased from 43% to 8% after removal.
Preliminary findings suggest removing docusate from
a standardized hospital order set is an effective intervention
to reduce use in hospitalized patients, including among
older adults.
Future goals include continued advocacy to remove
docusate from all standardized order sets throughout
our institution, in an effort to promote best practices in
the management of constipation and avoid inappropriate
prescribing among older adults.

99. Feasibility of Implementing the G8 Screening Tool in
Academic Oncology Clinics
Camilla Wong, Pauline Gulasingam, Susanna Cheng,
Rashida Haq
Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in older oncology
patients identifies issues not detected in standard history and
physical examination, optimizes non-oncologic issues, detects
geriatric variables with prognostic significance, influences
chemotherapy decisions and improves chemotherapy
tolerance. The G8 is an evidence-based screening tool,
developed for older cancer patients to triage which patients
should undergo a CGA. The primary objective is to determine
the feasibility of administering the G8 screening tool to new
patients aged ≥70 years in oncology clinics at St. Michael’s
Hospital and Sunnybrook Hospital.
New patients aged ≥70 years seen in oncology clinics
at St. Michael’s Hospital and Sunnybrook Hospital, with
a diagnosis of a malignancy in which systemic therapy is
being considered, were prospectively recruited. Exclusion
criteria were patients who cannot understand English or
were unable to provide consent and no substitute decision
maker was available. The G8 was administered by staff in the
oncology clinics. Feasibility was defined as the proportion
of eligible patients with a completed G8 screening tool.
The G8 was completed in 75% (40/53) and 65% (39/60)
of eligible patients at St. Michael’s Hospital and Sunnybrook
Hospital, respectively. Among eligible patients where a G8
was not completed, the reasons were patient not approached
in 68%, patient declined in 26%, and the G8 was only
partially completed in 6%. Among the 79 completed G8
tools, 70% had an abnormal G8 score.
Next steps include exploring facilitators and barriers to
G8 completion in order to develop a suite of strategies to
improve G8 uptake. An evaluation of the feasibility of G8
implementation is underway at a community hospital.
There is variability in completion rate of the G8 among
academic sites, with suboptimal uptake.

100. Staff Perceptions of Mandatory Reporting (MDS)
and Documentation in Long-Term Care Homes
Veronique  Boscart, Samantha Yang, Keia Johnson, Linda
Sheiban, Katherine McGilton
This study focused on exploring long-term care (LTC)
administrators’ perceptions of the minimum data set
(MDS) to promote high quality care for residents. This
study is part of a larger project to examine facilitators,
barriers and opportunities for optimal utilization of
regulated nurses in long-term care (LTC) settings and their
impact on quality of care and organizational outcomes.
A qualitative design employing case methodology was
used. Six administrators, five directors of care, and two
assistant directors of care, for a total of 24 participants took
part in individual interviews. The aim of these interviews
was to explore their perceptions of MDS and its potential
use to provide high quality care for residents in LTC. Data
was analyzed using cross-case synthesis.
Four themes emerged: (a) optimal use of MDS
to promote care in LTC; (b) limitations to utilizing
documentation in LTC; (c) the role of regulations in
promoting quality of care, and; (d) the value of verbal
communication between teams in LTC.
Intriguing dynamics took place between the perception
of administrators on regulator aspects and the role MDS
could play to increase quality of care. Furthermore, a
clearly identified skillset in using MDS data is needed to
collect and use the data to improve quality of care.
Perceptions of the use of MDS from an administrator
standpoint are interesting; however, this study only
covers one part of the story. Further research is necessary
to gain a nursing perception of MDS use, as well as a
quantitative exploration of the MDS data.

101. Falls Risk Signs Designed for Fall Prevention, Does
It Work? A Qualitative Study of Perspectives from
Clinical Assistants
Maggie Yongci Yu, Camilla Wong, Lianne Jeffs
Bedside falls risk signs are a common component of inhospital, multicomponent, fall prevention programs.
There have not been any studies of whether this individual
component is beneficial or harmful in falls prevention in
hospital. It has been postulated that these signs may deter
mobilization efforts. Since clinical assistants (CAs) play a
key role in mobilizing patients, the objective of this study is
to understand the perception of Falls Risk signs among CAs.
We recruited CAs from the General Internal Medicine
Unit at St. Michael Hospital to participate in a 20-minute
one-to-one semi-structured interview, consisting of 4-5
238

ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ABSTRACTS
open ended questions designed to explore emotional and
knowledge factors. Recruitment occurred until saturation
of themes was derived from the interviews. The interviews
were audio-recorded and transcribed. Each interview was
examined systematically, and independently by two study
personnel for themes.
Interim
We interviewed 15 CAs and the themes included:
1.	 CAs interpreted Falls Risk signage as a need for
increased vigilance such as performing more frequent
check on patients.
2.	 There was consensus among CAs to continue using the
Falls Risk signage.
3.	 CAs who were more experienced interpreted the Falls
Risk signage as a need to encourage more mobilization;
in contrast, less experienced CAs interpreted the signage
as a need to encourage more mobilization but were
hesitant to because of a lack of knowledge and skills.
A strategy should be implemented for CAs to increase
the knowledge and skills related to mobilization, to empower
their positive attitudes towards mobilization.
Fall Risk signage is perceived as useful by CAs and
should continue to be used.

102. Factors Influencing the Scope of Practice of Care of
the Elderly Physicians
Donald Yung, Vivian Ewa, Nathan Turley
Care of the elderly (CoE) physicians are family physicians
with enhanced skills in geriatrics and often have a diverse

CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 20, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2017

scope of practice. This study identifies the factors which
influence CoE physician scope of practice.
Semi-structured, one-to-one telephone interviews
were conducted with eleven CoE physicians practicing in
Alberta. One interview was not transcribed due to poor
audio quality. Ten transcripts were coded for themes
until saturation.
Factors for providing specialist services were
addressing an unmet need in their community, primary
interest in geriatrics, family, and financial reasons. In
contrast, factors for providing primary care services
were continuity of care and enjoyment of being a primary
care provider. Participants described their careers
evolving over time. Factors for participating in medical
education were enjoyment of teaching, professional
responsibility, positive experiences with preceptors,
previous teaching experience, and maintenance of
medical knowledge. Factors for doing research were
background in research, a perception of research’s
benefit to society, research funding, mentorship, and
culture of one’s academic department. Finally, factors for
involvement in administration and leadership activities
were opportunity and mentorship, and culture of the
academic’s department. Factors for abstaining from
research, administrative work, and leadership activities
were lack of interest, time, or experience.
We identified multiple factors influencing CoE
physician scope of practice. Two of the factors, addressing
an unmet need in their community and primary interest
in geriatrics, appear to be new. Others were similar to
those discussed in the literature.
Future research could compare the identified themes
with the experiences of CoE physicians across Canada.
Results may be relevant for stakeholders who influence
CoE physician scope of practice to meet the needs of
patients and healthcare system.
