Outcome Measures—Glucose and insulin concentrations, a homeostasis model assessment of
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol concentrations, triglyceride concentrations, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist
circumference, and body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared) percentile for age and sex.
Results—Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that increased sugar-sweetened
beverage intake was independently associated with increased HOMA-IR, systolic blood pressure,
waist circumference, and body mass index percentile for age and sex and decreased HDL
cholesterol concentrations; alternatively, increased physical activity levels were independently
associated with decreased HOMA-IR, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, and
triglyceride concentrations and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations.
Furthermore, low sugar-sweetened beverage intake and high physical activity levels appear to
modify each others' effects of decreasing HOMA-IR and triglyceride concentrations and
increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations.

Conclusions—Sugar-sweetened beverage intake and physical activity levels are each
independently associated with insulin resistance-associated metabolic parameters and
anthropometric measurements in adolescents. Moreover, low sugar-sweetened beverage intake and
high physical activity levels appear to modify each others' effects on several health-related
outcome variables.
THE INCREASING PREVA-lence of obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome
(a group of conditions associated with insulin resistance including hypertension,
dyslipidemia, central adiposity, and impaired glucose metabolism) in the pediatric
population is a global health issue, especially given that these conditions in childhood may
be antecedents to adult disease.1-6 As such, the long-term public health consequences of
these disorders in children and adolescents with respect to premature morbidity and
mortality are significant.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A considerable amount of research over the past decade has been devoted to studying the
genetic aspects of these conditions7-9 and which individuals may be predisposed to
disorders of weight management or insulin sensitivity. However, environmental factors are
also undoubtedly contributors to these conditions' development. Specifically, 2 lifestyle
behaviors associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome are (1) high
levels of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake10-14 and (2) low levels of physical
activity (PA).15-21 Dietary modifications and consistent exercise are thus 2
recommendations typically given by pediatricians to children and adolescents either at risk
for or currently diagnosed with these disorders.
Experimental studies support the hypothesis that SSBs may increase energy intake and
induce weight gain via their reduced satiety response, the promotion of a positive energy
balance by liquid calories relative to isoenergetic solid calories, and their dysregulation of
energy homeostasis.22-26 Although not all studies support an association between SSB
consumption and obesity,27,28 SSB intake has nonetheless been associated with increased
body weight, increased fat mass, dyslipidemia, and blood pressure.29,30 Experimental
studies also suggest that increased PA improves insulin sensitivity.20,21,31-39 Exercise

acutely improves insulin sensitivity for up to 48 hours because of an increase in insulinstimulated glucose transport and glycogen synthesis,40,41 and regular exercise training
induces long-term changes within the skeletal muscle that may improve whole-body insulin
sensitivity.35 Moreover, several clinical studies have shown that exercise improves a
subject's overall health.42,43
The increasing incidence and prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic
syndrome in the pediatric population is well recognized44-47; however, the relationship
between insulin resistance-associated metabolic parameters and anthropometric
measurements with SSB intake and PA levels in children and adolescents remains poorly
understood. Furthermore, studies evaluating the association of SSB consumption and
exercise with these conditions are limited,16,48 which is unfortunate given that a better
understanding of how diet and PA are related to these conditions may provide clinical and
public health information for prevention and treatment strategies.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Thus, to evaluate the relationship between insulin resistance-associated metabolic
parameters and anthropometric measurements with SSB intake and PA levels in the US
adolescent population, we analyzed these associations using data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during the years 1999-2004.

METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The NHANES is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and is designed to monitor the health and nutritional status
of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population. Since 1999, NHANES has been planned
and conducted as a continuous annual survey, and data are released in 2-year periods (eg,
1999-2000, 2001-2002). A nationally representative sample is selected annually using a
stratified multistage probability cluster sample design49; oversampling Mexican American
and black individuals, adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, persons 60 years and older, lowincome white individuals, and pregnant women permits more precise estimates for these
groups. This study is based on data obtained from NHANES 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and
2003-2004, as these were the most recently available NHANES that had released all of the
data needed for the inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, and outcome variables. The
NHANES protocol was approved by the National Center for Health Statistics institutional
review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants aged 18 years
and older; for participants younger than 18 years, written informed assent was obtained in
addition to parent or guardian consent. This study was approved by the institutional review
board at the University of California, Davis.
DATA COLLECTION
The NHANES protocol consists of a home interview performed by a trained interviewer
followed by a visit to an examination center where participants underwent physical
examinations, provided blood and urine samples, and completed additional questionnaires.
The details of the participant examinations and laboratory assessments are available on the

NHANES Web site.49 For our study, only data from participants aged 12 to 19 years were
analyzed; individuals were excluded from analyses if they were pregnant and/or used
steroids, blood glucose regulators, insulin, other antidiabetic agents, growth hormones, or
sex hormones.
MEASUREMENTS
Outcome variables included glucose levels, insulin levels, homeostasis model assessment of
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) measurements, total cholesterol levels, high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels,
triglyceride (TG) levels, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, waist
circumference (WC), and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared) percentile for age and sex (per the National Center for Health
Statistics references).50 The HOMA-IR ([fasting glucose in millimoles per liter×fasting
insulin in milliunits per milliliter]/22.5),51 LDL-C, and TG results were limited to those
who had completed at least an 8-hour fast. Mean WC is presented as the least squares mean,
controlling for age and sex.

DEFINITIONS

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Sugar-sweetened beverage information was obtained through a 24-hour dietary recall
interview. (In NHANES 2003-2004, the 24-hour recall was assessed on 2 separate days; the
first day was an in-person interview comparable with the previous NHANES study periods'
primary interview mode, whereas the second day was a telephone interview 3-10 days later.
For consistency in the methodology of data collection among the study periods, only the first
day of the NHANES 2003-2004 24-hour recall was used in our analyses.) Sugar-sweetened
beverages were defined as caloric soft drinks, colas, sugar-sweetened fruit drinks, or other
SSBs; pure fruit juices and diet soft drinks were not included. Sugar-sweetened beverage
intake in grams for each reported beverage was divided by 250 g (a serving equivalent;
approximately 8 ounces or a cup of beverage) and summed for each adolescent. In each
NHANES analyzed, low SSB intake was defined as the lowest quintile (≤20th percentile) of
the sum of the number of SSB serving equivalents a subject consumed per day; medium was
defined as the 2nd to 4th quintiles (>20th to <80th percentile); high was defined as the
highest quintile (≥80th percentile). Units of SSB intake are defined as the number of SSB
serving equivalents per day. Physical activity information was obtained during the interview
questionnaire. Low PA was defined as the lowest quintile (≤20th percentile) of the sum of
(the mean number of times a subject did activity per day) × (the average duration of each
time in minutes) × (the metabolic equivalent score)52,53; medium was defined as the 2nd to
4th quintiles (>20th to <80th percentile); high was defined as the highest quintile (≥80th
percentile).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were performed with SUDAAN version 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) using techniques appropriate for the complex
NHANES survey design. All of the analyses used the NHANES-provided sampling weights
that were calculated to take into account unequal probabilities of selection resulting from the
sample design, nonresponse, and planned oversampling of selected subgroups so the results

are representative of the US community-dwelling population. Dietary and activity variables
were analyzed both as continuous variables and in quintiles to minimize the chance that a
small number of extreme observations would have undue influence on the results.
Descriptive statistics summarize the data and are expressed as the mean (standard error
[SE]). Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to determine independent
associations between each outcome variable and the number of serving equivalents of SSBs
consumed and/or the levels of PA after adjusting for age, sex, race, and energy intake (in
kilocalories). Analyses involving female subjects were adjusted for the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of menarche. All P values are 2-sided and statistical significance was
established a priori at α=.05.

RESULTS
CHARACTERISTICS

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The baseline characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1. A total of 6967
adolescents were studied; the mean age of the participants was 15.5 years, 51.1% of the
participants were male, and 48.9% of the participants were female. The ethnic distribution of
the participants was 62.1% white, 14.8% black, 10.9% Mexican American, 5.3% other
(including multiracial), and 6.9% other Hispanic. For the metabolic evaluations, 442
individuals (approximately6% of the study population) were excluded from analyses
because of pregnancy and/or the use of steroids, blood glucose regulators, insulin, other
antidiabetic agents, growth hormones, or sex hormones.
METABOLIC PARAMETERS AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS ASSOCIATED
WITH SSB INTAKE

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The characteristics of the low-, medium-, and high-SSB intake groups as well as the results
of the multivariate linear regression analyses evaluating the relationship between SSB intake
and insulin resistance-associated metabolic parameters and anthropometric measurements
are shown in Table 2. The low-SSB intake group consumed a mean of 0.01 SSB serving
equivalents (approximately 0.1 oz) per day (SE, 0.003; range, 0-0.4 [approximately 0-3 oz]);
the medium-SSB intake group consumed a mean of 2.5 SSB serving equivalents
(approximately 20 oz) per day (SE, 0.03; range, 0.5-4.8 [approximately 4-38 oz]), and the
high-SSB intake group consumed a mean of 7.4 SSB serving equivalents (approximately 60
oz) per day (SE, 0.2; range, 4.9-33.4 [approximately 40-266 oz]). Each additional SSB
serving equivalent consumed per day was associated with a 5% increase in HOMA-IR, a
0.16-mm Hg increase in SBP, a 0.47-cm increase in WC, a 0.90-percentile increase in BMI
for age, and a 0.48-mg/dL decrease in HDL-C concentrations.
METABOLIC PARAMETERS AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS ASSOCIATED
WITH PA LEVELS
The characteristics of the low-, medium-, and high-PA level groups as well as the results of
the multivariate linear regression analyses evaluating the relationship between PA levels and
insulin resistance-associated metabolic parameters and anthropometric measurements are
shown in Table 3. In the low-PA group, 14.4% reported having engaged in at least 1
moderate activity during the past 30 days, whereas 7.4% reported having engaged in at least

1 vigorous activity during the past 30 days. In the medium-PA group, 75.4% reported having
engaged in at least 1 moderate activity during the past 30 days, whereas 79.8% reported
having engaged in at least 1 vigorous activity during the past 30 days. In the high-PA group,
74.6% reported having engaged in at least 1 moderate activity during the past 30 days,
whereas 96.9% reported having engaged in at least 1 vigorous activity during the past 30
days. Each incremental increase in PA level per day was associated with a 0.03% decrease
in HOMA-IR, a 0.004-mg/dL decrease in LDL-C concentrations, a 0.01-mg/dL decrease in
TG concentrations, and a 0.001-mg/dL increase in HDL-C concentrations.
METABOLIC PARAMETERS AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS ASSOCIATED
WITH SSB INTAKE AND PA LEVELS

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because the combination of dietary modification (with decreased SSB intake) and exercise
(with increased PA levels) are typically recommended to children and adolescents either at
risk for or currently diagnosed with obesity, insulin resistance, or metabolic syndrome, we
evaluated the factors associated with the combination of each extreme (ie, low SSB intake
and high PA vs high SSB intake and low PA level); the characteristics of the 2 groups as
well as the results of the multivariate linear regression analyses evaluating the relationship
between low SSB intake and high PA levels with insulin resistance-associated metabolic
parameters and anthropometric measurements are shown in Table 4. The combination of low
SSB intake and high PA levels was significantly associated with increased HDL-C
concentrations, a lower HOMA-IR, and lower TG concentrations. Furthermore, the finding
that the β coefficients for these 3 outcome variables (HDL-C concentrations, HOMA-IR, and
TG concentrations) are greater with the combination of low SSB intake and high PA levels
than with either alone suggests an effect modification.
SEX-SPECIFIC SUBGROUP ANALYSES

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because differences between the sexes may influence the metabolic parameters and
anthropometric measurements associated with SSB intake, PA levels, and their combination,
sex-specific subgroup analyses were also performed; these results are shown in Table 5.
(Although the NHANES 1999-2004 data did not include any information on pubertal status,
it did include the age of first menses in female subjects. Thus, we were able to control for
menarche in our subgroup analyses of female adolescents; subgroup analyses of male
adolescents are included for comparison.)
In female adolescents, each additional SSB serving equivalent consumed per day was
associated with a 7% increase in HOMA-IR, a 2.25-mg/dL increase in TG concentrations, a
0.38-mm Hg increase in SBP, a 0.75-cm increase in WC, a 0.84-percentile increase in BMI
for age, and a 0.73-mg/dL decrease in HDL-C concentration. However, in male adolescents,
each additional SSB serving equivalent consumed per day was associated with a 0.29-cm
increase in WC, a 0.78-percentile increase in BMI for age, and a 0.35-mg/dL decrease in
HDL-C concentration. Alternatively, each incremental increase in PA level in female
adolescents was only associated with a 0.01-mg/dL decrease in TG concentrations, whereas
each incremental increase in PA level in male adolescents was associated with a 0.04%
decrease in HOMA-IR, a 0.005-mg/dL decrease in LDL-C concentrations, a 0.01-mg/dL
decrease in TG concentrations, and a 0.001-cm decrease in WC. Furthermore, although the

combination of low SSB intake and high PA levels in female adolescents revealed no
significant associations with any insulin resistance-associated metabolic parameters or
anthropometric measurements, the combination of low SSB intake and high PA levels in
male adolescents was significantly associated with increased HDL-C concentrations, a lower
HOMA-IR, and lower TG concentrations.

COMMENT
In these nationally representative samples of US adolescents, we found significant
differences between the degrees of SSB intake and PA levels with insulin resistanceassociated metabolic parameters and anthropometric measurements.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that increased SSB consumption was
independently associated with increased HOMA-IR, SBP, WC, and BMI percentile for age
and sex and decreased HDL-C concentrations; alternatively, increased PA levels were
independently associated with decreased HOMA-IR, LDL-C concentrations, and TG
concentrations and increased HDL-C concentrations. Furthermore, low SSB intake and high
PA levels appear to modify each others' effects on decreasing HOMA-IR and TG
concentrations and increasing HDL-C concentrations. These findings thus support the
promotion of each lifestyle parameter (ie, decreased SSB consumption and increased PA
levels) in children or adolescents either at risk for or currently diagnosed with obesity,
insulin resistance, or metabolic syndrome.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Subgroup analyses based on sex also showed that SSB intake and PA levels were
independently associated with insulin resistance-associated metabolic parameters and
anthropometric differences; however, the associations of each were sex-specific. In female
adolescents, increased SSB consumption was associated with an increase in HOMA-IR, TG
concentrations, SBP, WC, and BMI percentile and a decrease in HDL-C concentrations.
However, in male adolescents, SSB consumption was only associated with an increase in
WC and BMI percentile and a decrease in HDL-C concentrations. Alternatively, increased
PA levels in female adolescents were only associated with a decrease in TG concentrations,
whereas increased PA levels in male adolescents were associated with a decrease in HOMAIR, LDL-C concentrations, TG concentrations, and WC. Furthermore, although the
combination of low-SSB intake and high PA levels revealed no significant associations with
any insulin resistance-associated metabolic parameters or anthropometric measurements in
female adolescents, the combination of low SSB intake and high PA levels was significantly
associated with a lower HOMA-IR, lower TG concentrations, and increased HDL-C
concentrations, just as it was when the cohort was studied in its entirety.
The sex-related differences that we observed with respect to the association of SSB intake
and PA levels with insulin resistance-associated metabolic parameters and anthropometric
measurements are intriguing; however, given the many physiological differences that exist
between male and female adolescents during the adolescent years and our limited ability in
female adolescents and inability in male adolescents to assess and control for pubertal status,
our results are not necessarily surprising. Furthermore, many other variables that we could

not account for during our analyses such as a subject's dietary behavior and precise body
composition measurements may have influenced our results.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Sugar-sweetened beverages may negatively affect hepatic metabolism and energy
homeostasis,24 and the consumption of SSBs has been implicated in many10,11,24,54 but
not all27,28 studies as a contributing factor to the increased incidence and prevalence of
overweight and obesity. The odds of a pediatric patient becoming obese—and therefore at
risk for developing metabolic syndrome—has been reported to increase
byapproximately60% for each additional SSB serving per day,12 and individuals who
consume a large portion of their daily energy in the form of SSBs are reported to have
increased body weight, increased fat mass, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure.29,30
Although discrepancy exists in the literature regarding the association of SSB intake with a
subject's metabolic status (which may in large part be because of the many types of studies
that have been performed [ie, prospective, cross-sectional, and retrospective—all with
different inclusion/exclusion criteria and means of data analysis]), our study shows an
independent relationship between increased SSB intake and increased HOMA-IR, SBP, WC,
and BMI percentile for age and sex and decreased HDL-C concentrations, thus supporting
the beneficial relationship of limited SSB intake with insulin resistance-associated
parameters.
Alternatively, PA causes more of its metabolicchanging effects by its action on skeletal
muscle, and regular exercise induces long-term changes within the skeletal muscle that
improve whole-body insulin sensitivity.35,40,41 Although there have been fewer
epidemiological studies regarding the association of PA levels with overweight and obesity
in children, data from large adult studies42,43 have convincingly shown the metabolic
benefits of increased exercise. Moreover, a recent study in adolescents showed that
moderate PA was positively related to improved glucose metabolism and resting energy
expenditure.55 Our study further supports the metabolic and health benefits of exercise and
shows an independent relationship between increased PA levels and decreased HOMA-IR,
LDL-C concentrations, and TG concentrations and increased HDL-C concentrations.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Importantly, the finding that the absolute values of the β coefficients from our multivariate
linear regression analyses were consistently smaller for the PA analyses than for the SSB
analyses does not diminish the significance of exercise and its relationship with insulin
resistance-associated parameters; rather, it is a reflection of the methodology used. Sugarsweetened beverage intake was defined as the number of SSB serving equivalents a subject
consumed per day, whereas PA levels were defined as (the mean number of times a subject
did activity per day) × (the average duration of each time in minutes) × (the metabolic
equivalent score). As would be expected from its determination from multiple variables, a
much wider range of PA levels were calculated in the study population than SSB intake
levels, influencing the effect of a single unit of incremental change on the outcome.
However, based on our model, even a small increase in daily exercise by an individual (eg,
increasing the mean number of times a subject engaged in PA from 2 to 3 per day and
increasing the average duration of physical activity from 10 to 15 minutes) would have a
profound effect on their calculated PA level (increasing it by 225%), leading to larger

changes in the outcome variables than would be expected by the small value of the β
coefficient.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given that the biological effects of SSB consumption and exercise are different, we were not
surprised to find that the combination of low SSB intake and high PA levels appeared to
modify each others' effects on several insulin resistance-associated parameters. However,
the fact that we only observed this effect for HOMA-IR, HDL-C concentrations, and TG
concentrations, but not the other outcome variables, is interesting and requires further
investigation with well-designed prospective studies. Nevertheless, HOMA-IR, HDL-C
concentrations, and TG concentrations are commonly used in clinical practice as markers of
a subject's metabolic status, and thus our data suggest that promoting decreased SSB
consumption and increased levels of exercise in adolescents is important for overall health.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our study has several significant limitations. First, because our study is cross-sectional, all
we are able to report are associations as opposed to causality. Second, because the pubertal
status of our subjects was not documented in the NHANES periods that we studied, we are
unable to adjust our analyses for the subjects' degree of sexual maturation. Third, studies
such as ours that use questionnaire data have inherent limitations: (1) the recall method is
subject to inaccuracy and bias, especially with behaviors such as dietary habits56 and levels
of exercise52; and (2) an individual's dietary habits and levels of exercise can vary greatly
from one day to the next, limiting the reliability of short-term recall on long-term patterns.
However, given that overweight subjects often underreport their levels of energy intake56
and less active adolescents often overestimate their degree of physical fitness,52 we can
have confidence in our results because these biases would be expected to diminish rather
than enhance our ability to find significant associations between SSB consumption and PA
levels with insulin resistance-associated measures.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In summary, we report that SSB intake and PA levels are each independently associated
with insulin resistance- associated metabolic parameters and anthropometric measurements
in adolescents; moreover, low SSB intake and high PA levels appear to modify each others'
effect on several health-related outcome variables. Thus, although prospective studies are
needed to directly test the effects of dietary modification and consistent exercise on the
development of obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome in the pediatric
population, pediatricians should continue promoting these lifestyle modifications in efforts
to improve overall health.

β (SE) are for SSB intake and PA level compared with high SSB intake and low PA level, adjusting for age, sex, race, menarche (for female adolescents), and energy intake (in kilocalories).

Low PA defined as the lowest quintile of the sum of the mean number of times a subject did activity per day × the average duration of each time × metabolic equivalent score; medium defined as the
second through fourth quintile; high PA defined as the highest quintile. β (SE) are for the sum of the mean number of times a subject did activity per day × the average duration of each time × metabolic
equivalent score of activity, adjusting for the number of serving equivalents of SSBs consumed per day, age, sex, race, menarche (for female adolescents), and energy intake (in kilocalories).

Low SSB intake defined as the lowest quintile of the sum of the number of serving equivalents of caloric soft drinks, colas, sugar-sweetened fruit drinks, or other SSBs consumed per day; medium defined
as the second through fourth quintile; high SSB intake defined as the highest quintile. β (SE) are for the number of serving equivalents of SSBs consumed per day, adjusting for amount of physical activity
performed per day, age, sex, race, menarche (for female adolescents), and energy intake (in kilocalories).

SI conversions: To convert total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259; to convert TG to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0113.

Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); DBP, diastolic blood pressure; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HOMA-IR,
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; PA, physical activity; SBP, systolic blood pressure; SE, standard error; SSB, sugar-sweetened beverage;
TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglyceride; WC, waist circumference.
