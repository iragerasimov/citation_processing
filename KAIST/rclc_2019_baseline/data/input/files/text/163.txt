Abstract
Anemia is one of the many complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the current prevalence of anemia in
CKD patients in the United States is not known. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
in 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 were used to determine the prevalence of anemia in subjects with CKD. The analysis was
limited to adults aged .18 who participated in both the interview and exam components of the survey. Three outcomes
were assessed: the prevalence of CKD, the prevalence of anemia in subjects with CKD, and the self-reported treatment of
anemia. CKD was classified into 5 stages based on the glomerular filtration rate and evidence of kidney damage, in
accordance with the guidelines of the National Kidney Foundation. Anemia was defined as serum hemoglobin levels #12 g/
dL in women and #13 g/dL in men. We found that an estimated 14.0% of the US adult population had CKD in 2007–2010.
Anemia was twice as prevalent in people with CKD (15.4%) as in the general population (7.6%). The prevalence of anemia
increased with stage of CKD, from 8.4% at stage 1 to 53.4% at stage 5. A total of 22.8% of CKD patients with anemia
reported being treated for anemia within the previous 3 months–14.6% of patients at CKD stages 1–2 and 26.4% of patients
at stages 3–4. These results update our knowledge of the prevalence and treatment of anemia in CKD in the United States.

of life issues (e.g., fatigue, reduced productivity) are common [3,5].
The prevalence of anemia (with or without CKD) increases with
age [8,9], which means that, as the US population ages, the
number of people affected by anemia in CKD will also increase.
Available population-based determinations of the prevalence of
anemia in CKD are becoming dated, with many studies referring
back to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) III, which ended in 1994 [8,10–12]. The most recent
studies include NHANES data up to 2006 [8,13], but one was
limited to adults over age 64 with advanced CKD [13] and the
other used a GFR classification not directly comparable to that of
most other studies [8]. This analysis assessed the prevalence of
anemia in CKD in the adult (.18 years of age) US population
during 2007–2010 using the GFR categories specified by the
National Kidney Foundation.

Introduction
The kidneys function as filters of the blood, removing waste
products and controlling the balance of fluid and electrolytes.
Filtration occurs via bundles of capillaries called glomeruli
(singular, glomerulus). A reduction in the glomerular filtration
rate (GFR ) to ,60 mL/min/1.73 m2 indicates chronic kidney
disease (CKD), as do structural or functional renal abnormalities,
which may be present in people with normal GFR [1]. Crosssectional estimates of the prevalence of CKD in the United States
range from 1.5% to 15.6% [2].
One of the lesser known functions of the kidneys is the
production of erythropoietin, a signaling molecule that stimulates
red blood cell production, in response to decreased oxygen levels
in the blood. Any disruption of this process, e.g., secondary to a
functional abnormality due to CKD, has the potential to produce
anemia, a condition in which the number of circulating red blood
cells, and therefore the level of hemoglobin, is lower than normal
[3].
Other possible causes of anemia in CKD include iron
deficiency, inflammation, and the accumulation of uremic toxins
[3,4]. Thus, the abnormal composition of blood or urine is an
additional indicator of kidney damage.
Anemia in CKD is associated with cognitive impairment, sleep
disturbances, CKD progression, cardiovascular comorbidities, and
higher mortality [3,5–7]. Direct healthcare costs are higher in
CKD patients with anemia than in those without [7], and quality

Methods
Study Design and Data Source
This was an analysis of cross-sectional data from the NHANES
in 2007–2008 and 2009–2010. The NHANES is a biennial
national survey that assesses the physical health of the noninstitutionalized civilian population in the United States (www.cdc.
gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). It is carried out and overseen by the
National Center for Health Statistics, whose institutional review
board approves each survey cycle.

Anemia in CKD in the United States

Results

Study Sample
The study sample comprised adult subjects aged .18 years who
participated in both the interview and examination components of
NHANES. Participants provided written informed consent at the
time of the survey.

Participants
A total of 12,077 adults participated in the interview and
examination components of the NHANES surveys in 2007–2008
and 2009–2010.

Study Variables

Prevalence of CKD

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using the
formula GFR = 1756(SCr)21.1546(age)20.2036(0.742 if female)6(1.210 if African American), where SCr is serum creatinine
in mg/dL and age is expressed in years [14]. GFR units are mL/
min/1.73 m2. CKD was classified into five stages defined by the
GFR and/or evidence of kidney damage, as recommended by the
National Kidney Foundation [14] and shown in Table 1. Evidence
of kidney damage was derived from the presence of albuminuria,
which is defined as a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)
$30 mg/g [14]. The NHANES 2009–2010 data set provided a
variable for the urinary ACR (URDACT), but the 2007–2008
data set did not. Therefore, the urinary ACR was calculated for
both survey periods from the variables for urinary albumin and
creatinine as follows: ACR (mg/g) = urinary albumin (mg/dL)/
urinary creatinine (g/dL). Stage of CKD was not calculated if data
for either GFR or ACR were missing, except when GFR values
alone indicated CKD of stages 3–5. Anemia was defined as serum
hemoglobin levels #12 g/dL in women and #13 g/dL in men, as
recommended by the National Anemia Action Council and the
World Health Organization [15,16].

The prevalence of CKD was 14.0% (Table 2). This represents
an estimated 31.4 million people in the US population. About half
(48.4%) of the people with CKD were at stage 3. A similar
proportion (46.9%) was in stages 1–2 combined. Only 4.7% were
in stages 4–5.

Prevalence of Anemia in CKD
The prevalence of anemia in the combined survey population,
regardless of CKD, was 7.6% (result not shown). The prevalence
of anemia was 15.4% in people with CKD (Table 3). This
represents an estimated 4.8 million people. The prevalence of
anemia increased with stage of CKD, from 8.4% at stage 1 to
53.4% at stage 5. The prevalence of anemia in people without
CKD was 6.3%.

Treatment of Anemia
A total of 22.8% of CKD patients with anemia reported being
treated for it (Table 4). Treatment frequencies were similar at
stages 1 and 2 (12.1% and 16.2%; P = 0.57; weighted mean
14.6%) and stages 3 and 4 (26.5% and 20.7%; P = 0.76; weighted
mean 26.4%).

Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed in Stata MP v. 12.1 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX). Four-year sample weights were calculated
for the combined survey cycles as described in the NHANES
analytic guidelines [17]. The sample weights were applied to
calculate the proportions of subjects with CKD, anemia, and
treatment for anemia. Standard errors obtained by Taylor series
linearization were used to obtain 95% confidence intervals. Each
outcome was determined for all subjects and by stage of CKD.
The ‘subpopulation’ option in Stata was used for analyses of
subgroups. Subjects with no calculated stage of CKD (N = 977;
8.1%) were classified as not having CKD. The prevalence of
anemia was determined in all subjects and then separately in
subjects with and without CKD. Treatment for anemia was
assessed only in subjects with anemia (and CKD). Prevalence
values were converted to projections of the respective numbers in
the US population based on the 2000 US census.

Discussion
In our analysis of NHANES data from 2007–2010, an estimated
14.0% of the US population had CKD. There are several
indications that this value represents a slightly increasing
prevalence of CKD in the United States. The first is a comparison
with an analysis of the NHANES III (1988–1994), in which the
prevalence of CKD was 11.0% [18]. Secondly, the unweighted
prevalence of CKD in the NHANES 1999–2004 surveys was
reported to be 16.8% [19], slightly lower than the unweighted
prevalence in the current study (17.6%). Thirdly, Coresh et al.
reported prevalence values of 9.4–13.1% for stages 1–4 of CKD in
various analyses covering NHANES III through 2004 [20,21].
Our analysis of stages 1–4 in years 2007–2010 yielded an
estimated prevalence of 13.9%. Finally, reports on the Kidney
Early Evaluation Program (KEEP) cohort of patients at high risk
for CKD indicate that 15.6% of the cohort had GFRs
corresponding to CKD stages 3–5 in 2000–2001 [22], whereas
16.8% met this criterion over the period 2000–2009 [23].
In our analysis, anemia was estimated to be present in 15.4% of
people with any stage of CKD. The prevalence of anemia
increased with stage of CKD, from 8.4% at stage 1 to 53.4% at
stage 5. A similar trend has been reported by several other authors
[11,24,25], consistent with the known pathogenesis of CKD (i.e.,
that erythropoietin production decreases as kidney function
worsens). Fishbane et al. found high rates of iron deficiency in
adult men (57.8 to 58.8%) and women (69.9 to 72.8%) with CKD
stages 3–5 in the NHANES III and 1999–2004 surveys [12],
indicating that anemia in higher stage CKD may have multiple
causes.
Other studies of the prevalence of anemia in CKD focused on
older adults (.64 years of age). According to Stevens et al., 29.9%
of KEEP 2000–08 participants and 19.9% of NHANES 1999–
2006 subjects in CKD stages 3–5 and over age 64 had comorbid

anemia, defined as hemoglobin levels ,13.5 g/dL for men and
,12 g/dL for women [13]. For comparison, the prevalence of
anemia in stage 3–5 CKD patients aged .64 in the 2007–2010
NHANES surveys was 24.4%. A higher prevalence of anemia
(64.9%; defined as hemoglobin ,13 g/dL for men, ,12 g/dL for
women) was observed in US nursing home residents aged .64
with CKD stages 3–5 [25].
Treatments for anemia include iron supplementation and
erythropoietin stimulating agents. Reported treatment rates are
typically low (10–15%), regardless of the source of data. In an
analysis of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1996–
2002), just 10% of outpatient visits for anemia management in
CKD resulted in prescription of medication for anemia [26]. In an
online survey conducted in 2006, just 15% of 376 family medicine
and internal medicine trainees in the United States reported that
they would initiate treatment for anemia in CKD at hemoglobin
levels ,11 g/dL [27]. In our analysis of NHANES 2007–2010,
22.8% of CKD patients with anemia reported being treated for
anemia within the previous 3 months.
Insight into the usual timing and types of treatments received (at
least among older men) can be gleaned from a study of the
Veterans Health Administration database by Lawler et al. [28].
Among 89,000 patients with anemia and CKD (96.7% male,
median age 77.5), 7.1% initiated erythropoietin stimulating agents
within a year of diagnosis of anemia, while 30.8% initiated iron

therapy and 16.5% used blood transfusions in the same time span.
The median time to erythropoietin stimulating agent initiation was
138 days.
CKD prevalence values can vary markedly depending on how
GFR is estimated [23,29]. We chose to use the definitions of CKD
and GFR established by the National Kidney Foundation to
maximize the comparability of our results with previous NHANES
and other studies that used these same definitions. We note that a
new method for estimating GFR has been shown to be slightly
more accurate in classifying patients by stage of CKD [23]. In
addition, hemoglobin levels may vary not only by sex but also by
age, pregnancy, altitude and smoking status [30]. We used the
definitions of anemia given by the National Anemia Action
Council and the World Health Organization for simplicity, but did
not account for the variables listed above. Our analysis of
treatment for anemia was limited by the fact that NHANES data
on the various treatments for anemia (e.g., ESAs, iron) were
sparse.
Several elements of the study design may have skewed our
estimation of the prevalence of CKD. First, inclusion of subject
with missing data on GFR and/or ACR likely resulted in
underestimation of the full number of people with CKD. On the
other hand, albuminuria was assessed with a single spot urine test
in NHANES and may have been a temporary condition, resulting
in overestimation of the number of subjects at CKD stages 1–2.
Lastly, as described in other NHANES-based analyses of CKD,
‘‘nonparticipation rates caused by illness relating to having a very
low GFR are expected to be particularly high in [stage 5], severely

In summary, CKD prevalence appears to be increasing in the
US adult population. In 2007–2010, anemia was present in
approximately 15% of CKD patients and was more frequent at
higher stages of CKD. Relatively few CKD patients with anemia
were being treated for anemia.
