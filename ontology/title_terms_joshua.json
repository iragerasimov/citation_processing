        "abstract": "The hydroxyl radical as an indicator of SEP fluxes in the high-latitude terrestrial atmosphere. The low background values at nighttime of the mesospheric hydroxyl (OH) radical make it easier to single out the atmospheric response to the external solar forcing in Polar Regions. Because of the short lifetime of HOx, it is possible to follow the trails of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events in the terrestrial atmosphere, as shown by Storini and Damiani (2008). The sensitivity of this indicator makes discernible not only extreme particle events with a flux peak of several thousand pfu [1 pfu = 1 particle/(cm2 s sr)] at energies >10 MeV, but also those with lower flux up to about 300 pfu. Using data from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on board the EOS AURA satellite, we examined the correlation of OH abundance vs. solar proton flux for almost all the identified SEP events spanning from November 2004 to December 2006 (later on no more SEP events occurred during Solar Cycle no. 23). The channels at energies greater than 5 MeV and 10 MeV showed the best correlation values (r \u223c 0.90\u20130.95) at altitudes around 65\u201375 km whereas, as expected, the most energetic channels were most highly correlated at lower altitudes. Therefore, it is reasonably possible to estimate the solar proton flux from values of mesospheric OH (and viceversa) and it could be useful in studying periods with gaps in the records of solar particles.\n\nIn addition, the SEP events of September 2005, characterized by an evident hemispheric asymmetry of the SEP-induced OH formation, have been examined separately. The impact of the SEPs on the hydroxyl radical was appreciably stronger in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern at altitudes above roughly 60 km and also the nighttime OH layer was involved. Preliminary analyses performed with other MLS data (i.e., O3, H2O, T) suggest that atmospheric in situ conditions could play a relevant role in explaining the hemispheric asymmetry of OH."

        "abstract": "The 27 day solar rotational effect on mesospheric nighttime OH and O <sub>3</sub> observations induced by geomagnetic activity. Observations performed by the Earth Observing System Microwave Limb Sounder instrument on board the Aura satellite from 2004 to 2009 (2004 to 2014) were used to investigate the 27\u2009day solar rotational cycle in mesospheric OH (O3) and the physical connection to geomagnetic activity. Data analysis was focused on nighttime measurements at geomagnetic latitudes connected to the outer radiation belts (55\u00b0N/S\u201375\u00b0N/S). The applied superposed epoch analysis reveals a distinct 27\u2009day solar rotational signal in OH and O3 during winter in both hemispheres at altitudes >70\u2009km. The OH response is positive and in\u2010phase with the respective geomagnetic activity signal, lasting for 1\u20132\u2009days. In contrast, the O3 feedback is negative, delayed by 1\u2009day, and is present up to 4\u2009days afterward. Largest OH (O3) peaks are found at ~75\u2009km, exceeding the 95% significance level and the measurement noise of <2% (<0.5%), while reaching variations of +14% (\u22127%) with respect to their corresponding background. OH at 75\u2009km is observed to respond to particle precipitation only after a certain threshold of geomagnetic activity is exceeded, depending on the respective OH background. The relation between OH and O3 at 75\u2009km in both hemispheres is found to be nonlinear. In particular, OH has a strong impact on O3 for relatively weak geomagnetic disturbances and accompanying small absolute OH variations (<0.04\u2009ppb). In contrast, catalytic O3 depletion is seen to slow down for stronger geomagnetic variations and OH anomalies (0.04\u20130.13\u2009ppb), revealing small variations around \u22120.11\u2009ppm."

        "abstract": "Spatial Heterodyne Imager for Mesospheric Radicals on STPSat-1. The Spatial Heterodyne Imager for Mesospheric Radicals (SHIMMER) was a high\u2010resolution, near ultraviolet spectrometer that imaged the Earth's limb for 2.5 years between March 2007 and October 2009. The instrument used the Spatial Heterodyne Spectroscopy technique for the first time on a satellite and successfully demonstrated its capabilities. SHIMMER measured the solar resonance fluorescence of the OH A2\u03a3+\u2010X2\u03a0 (0, 0) band around 309 nm, which allows the retrieval of mesospheric OH density profiles. It also measured the Rayleigh scattered background from the clear atmosphere and solar scattering from polar mesospheric cloud particles. We present details on the SHIMMER mission, the payload design, and the data analysis. A comparison between SHIMMER and concurrent Microwave Limb Sounder OH data shows good agreement between 60 and 90 km altitude for several latitudes and seasons. We also find good agreement of the SHIMMER OH densities and standard photochemical model calculations between 60 and 80 km. We find no evidence of a 25%\u201335% mesospheric OH deficit, previously reported using Middle Atmosphere High\u2010Resolution Spectrograph Investigation (MAHRSI) OH data. However, independent analysis of Rayleigh scattered background signals observed by SHIMMER and MAHRSI under similar lighting conditions revealed that MAHRSI radiances are systematically smaller than SHIMMER radiances by 24%. Although this difference is well outside of the combined uncertainties for both experiments, the agreement of SHIMMER OH with Microwave Limb Sounder OH and standard photochemistry results, together with our Rayleigh scattering comparison, suggests an unidentified MAHRSI calibration problem that effectively eliminates the mesospheric OH deficit reported using MAHRSI observations."

        "abstract": "Spatial and Temporal Structure of the Tertiary Ozone Maximum in the Polar Winter Mesosphere. Observations from satellites and a ground\u2010based station are combined to construct a global data set for investigating the tertiary ozone maximum in the winter mesosphere for the period August 2004 to June 2017. These give a comprehensive picture of this ozone maximum in latitude, pressure, and time. The location of the tertiary ozone maximum shifts in latitude and pressure with the evolving season; the ozone peak occurs at lower latitude and higher pressure around the winter solstice. Highest average nighttime ozone concentrations and greatest degree of interannual variability are seen in late winter in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). The hemispheric differences and interannual variability in nighttime ozone are related to variations of temperature, H2O, and OH associated with dynamical activity. Elevated stratopause events in the NH winter are associated with transport of air that is depleted in H2O and enhanced in OH; photochemistry then leads to downward displacement of the altitude of maximum ozone and enhancement in the ozone amount. Transport by planetary waves in the NH extends the region of high ozone further from the pole and leads to longitudinal variations. The analysis shows that while the tertiary ozone maximum responds to a particular radiative situation as shown in previous studies, it is also the result of very dry air found in the winter polar mesosphere."

We present simulations of stratospheric ozone depletion in the Arctic winter 2004/2005 by the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). This winter is among the coldest on record with large observed ozone losses. It is also different from previously analyzed winters, as ozone mixing ratios within the polar vortex were not homogeneously distributed. The reason for the untypical ozone distribution is a second transport barrier that existed at the time of vortex formation. The simulations agree well with ozone measurements by the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE\u2010FTS). The simulated vortex average column ozone loss between 380 and 550 K potential temperature (\u00b11\u03c3 ) was 69 \u00b1 21 Dobson Units on 23 March. The simulated ozone loss is in approximate agreement with some published estimates, but is significantly lower than others. A possible reason for this difference is the inhomogeneous ozone distribution within the vortex which makes it more complicated to estimate of ozone loss."

        "abstract": "Resolving the Model-Observation Discrepancy in the Mesospheric and Stratospheric HO <sub> <i>x</i> </sub> Chemistry: Resolving the Discrepancy in HO <sub> <i>x</i> </sub>. We examine the middle atmospheric odd\u2010hydrogen (HOx ) chemistry by comparing the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) OH and HO2 measurements with a photochemical model simulation. The model underestimates mesospheric OH and HO2 concentrations if the standard chemical kinetic rates are used, whether the model H2O and O3 are constrained with observations or not. To resolve the discrepancies, we adjust the kinetic rate coefficients of three key reactions (O + OH \u2192 O2 + H, OH + HO2 \u2192 H2O + O2, and H + O2 + M \u2192 HO2 + M) and the O2 photo absorption cross section at Lyman \u03b1 (121.57 nm) using the Bayesian optimal estimation. A much better model\u2010observation agreement can be achieved if the kinetic rate coefficients for H + O2 + M \u2192 HO2 + M is increased by 134\u2013310%, and the O2 photo absorption cross section at Lyman \u03b1 is reduced by 33\u201354%, while the kinetic rate coefficients for O + OH \u2192 O2 + H and OH + HO2 \u2192 H2O + O2 remain consistent with the current laboratory values. The kinetic rate coefficient for H + O2 + M \u2192 HO2 + M requires a very large adjustment beyond the uncertainty limits recommended in the NASA Data Evaluation, suggesting the need for future laboratory measurements. An alternative explanation is that the radiative association reaction, H + O2 \u2192 HO2 + h \u03bd, plays a significant role, which has never been measured. Our results demonstrate that high\u2010quality satellite observations can be used to constrain photochemical parameters and help improve our understanding of atmospheric chemistry."

        "abstract": "Precipitating radiation belt electrons and enhancements of mesospheric hydroxyl during 2004-2009: MESOSPHERIC OH RESPONSE. Energetic particle precipitation leads to enhancement of odd hydrogen (HOx) below 80 km altitude through water cluster ion chemistry. Using measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS/Aura) and Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED/POES) between 2004\u20132009, we study variations of nighttime OH caused by radiation belt electrons at geomagnetic latitudes 55\u201365\u00b0. For those months with daily mean 100\u2013300 keV electron count rate exceeding 150 counts/s in the outer radiation belt, we find a strong correlation (r \u2265 0.6) between OH mixing ratios at 70\u201378 km (0.046\u20130.015 hPa) and precipitating electrons. Correlations r \u2265 0.35, corresponding to random chance probability p \u2264 5%, are observed down to52 km (0.681 hPa), while no clear correlation is observed at altitudes below. This suggests that the fluxes of \u22653 MeV electrons were not high enough to cause observable changes in OH mixing ratios. At 75 km, in about 34% of the 65 months analyzed we find a correlation r \u2265 0.35. Although similar results are obtained for both hemispheres in general, in some cases the differences in atmospheric conditions make the OH response more difficult to detect in the South. Considering the latitude extent of electron forcing, we find clear effects on OH at magnetic latitudes 55\u201372\u00b0, while the lower latitudes are influenced much less. Because the time period 2004\u20132009 analyzed here coincided with an extended solar minimum, and the year 2009 was anomalously quiet, it is reasonable to assume that our results provide a lower\u2010limit estimation of the importance of energetic electron precipitation at the latitudes considered."

This validates the Spatial Heterodyne Spectroscopy technique for space\u2010borne optical remote sensing applications. We extend our analysis to other local times, not observed by MLS, for latitudes near 55\u00b0N in the summer of 2007.

        "abstract": "First measurements of ClO in the Venus atmosphere \u2013 Altitude dependence and temporal variation. The 352.88\u202fGHz submm absorption spectrum of 35ClO in the Venus atmosphere was observed on Oct 23 and Nov 11, 2010, using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) on Mauna Kea, HI. This is the first detection of Venus ClO, which is found to exhibit much larger abundances in the upper (85\u2013100\u202fkm) versus lower (70\u201385\u202fkm) mesosphere, based upon retrieval of the altitude distribution from the shape of the pressure broadened absorption. The 2-day average of all collected data indicates 2.6\u202f\u00b10.5 ppb above 85\u202f\u00b12\u202fkm, and undetectable below. Temporal variation is evident between the Oct 23 and Nov 11 observations, which indicate upper mesospheric mixing ratios of 3.7\u202f\u00b10.9 and 1.5\u202f\u00b10.5 ppb, respectively. At these abundances catalytic destruction of ozone by highly reactive chlorine compounds (ClOx) must occur, reinforcing the (Montmessin et al., 2011) conclusion that their measured ozone profiles were consistent with chlorine-catalyzed ozone destruction above 90\u202fkm. Detection of ClO in the nightside atmosphere reveals that ClOx abundances exceed those of highly reactive nitrogen (NOx). Recent observations of HCl in both the night- and day-side atmosphere (Sandor and Clancy, 2012; 2017) demonstrate that upper mesospheric HCl represents less than half the total chlorine budget. This required a non-HCl reservoir consisting of highly reactive gas-phase chlorine compounds (ClOx), HCl aerosol particles, or both. The measured 1.5\u20133.7 ppb ClO directly indicates hundreds of ppb of Cl, demonstrating that ClOx (rather than aerosol) is a primary upper mesospheric chlorine reservoir. Finally, this first detection of ClO constitutes the first empirical corroboration that the (Yung and DeMore, 1982) chlorine-catalysis mechanism is responsible for stabilizing the Venus atmosphere as 97% CO2, 3% N2 (rather than comparable (within a factor of 2) CO, O2 and CO2 abundances)."

        "abstract": "Comparison of ClO measurements from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder to ground-based microwave measurements at Scott Base, Antarctica, in spring 2005. We have examined measurements of chlorine monoxide, ClO, in the lower stratosphere by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura satellite in the austral spring of 2005. These measurements have been compared to those of a ground\u2010based spectrometer at Scott Base, Antarctica. The data analysis is performed in both cases by subtracting nighttime measurements from daytime ones. The transition from full darkness to full daylight at the high latitude of Scott Base limits the time during which both day and night measurements are made. After further selection for good observing conditions and the position of the polar vortex, 16 valid profile comparisons are made. The day\u2010to\u2010day variability of ClO is observed to be large, \u223c30% of its peak value. The daily column densities of the two instruments are correlated with a significance of 3\u03c3 with most of the mean difference arising from 2 days. The statistical agreement between MLS and the Scott Base instrument is good. Scott Base values are on average marginally but not significantly larger, by 0.10 \u00b1 0.07 ppb, or 11 \u00b1 8% (1\u03c3 ), in peak mixing ratio, than the MLS values."

        "abstract": "Analysis of Diurnal and Seasonal Behavior of Surface Ozone and Its Precursors (NOx) at a Semi-Arid Rural Site in Southern India. Surface measurements of O3, NO, NO2 and NOx have been made over a semi-arid rural site, Anantapur (14.62\u00b0N; 77.65\u00b0E; 331 m asl) in southern India, during January-December 2010. The highest monthly mean O3 concentration was observed in April (56.1 \u00b1 9.9 ppbv) and the lowest in August (28.5 \u00b1 7.4), with an annual mean of 40.7 \u00b1 8.7 ppbv for the observation period. Seasonal variations in O3 concentrations were the highest during the summer (70.2 \u00b1 6.9 ppbv), and lowest during the monsoon season (20.0 \u00b1 4.7 ppbv), with an annual mean of 40.7 \u00b1 8.7 ppbv. In contrast, higher NOx values appeared in the winter (12.8 \u00b1 0.8 ppbv) followed by the summer season (10.9 \u00b1 0.7 ppbv), while lower values appeared in the monsoon season (3.7 \u00b1 0.5 ppbv). The results for O3, NO and NO2 indicate that the level of oxidant concentration ([OX] = NO2 + O3) at a given location is the sum of NOx-independent \u201cregional contribution\u201d (background level of O3) and linearly NOx-dependent \u201clocal contribution\u201d. The O3 concentration shows a significant positive correlation with temperature, and a negative correlation with both wind speed and relative humidity. In contrast, NOx have a significant positive correlation with humidity and wind speed, and negative correlation with temperature. The slope between [BC] and [O3] suggests that every 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in black carbon aerosol mass concentration causes a reduction of 4.7 \u03bcg/m3 in the surface ozone concentration. A comparative study using satellite data shows that annual mean values of tropospheric ozone contributes 12% of total ozone, while near surface ozone contributes 82% of tropospheric ozone. The monthly mean variation of tropospheric ozone is similar to that tropospheric NO2, with a correlation coefficient of +0.80."

Nearly coincident observations of HNO3, HCl, N2O, and H2O in the vicinity of the northern polar vortex during the NASA Polar Aura Validation Experiment (PAVE) in January and February 2005 have shown reasonably good agreement between aircraft\u2010borne infrared spectrometer results and results from High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS), Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) instruments aboard the EOS Aura satellite. Mixing ratio profile and column results show that special attention must be given to retrievals that may be disturbed by the dynamics and chemical processing of the polar vortex. Largest differences occur on days when observations were made in regions of the vortex with large gradients in wind and potential vorticity, and the differences were especially noticeable in results for HNO3 and HCl, whose profiles may be dramatically changed by vortex activity. The mean difference between coincident column observations by MLS and the Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) is 2.4%, VMR profile amounts generally are in good agreement between the satellite observations where they are available. The average difference between coincident HCl column observations by MLS and the FTS is 4.6%."

        "abstract": "A nudged chemistry-climate model simulation of chemical constituent distribution at northern high-latitude stratosphere observed by SMILES and MLS during the 2009/2010 stratospheric sudden warming: A NUDGED CCM SIMULATION OF THE 2010 SSW. Stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) is a dramatic phenomenon of the winter stratosphere in which the distribution of chemical constituents, associated chemical tendency, and transport of chemical constituents differ significantly inside and outside of the polar vortex. In this study, the chemical constituent distributions in the major SSW of 2009/2010 were simulated by the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate 3.2\u2010Chemistry\u2010Climate Model (CCM) nudged toward the European Center for Medium\u2010Range Weather Forecasts\u2010Interim Re\u2010Analysis data. The results were compared with Superconducting Submillimeter\u2010Wave Limb\u2010Emission Sounder (SMILES) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) observations. In addition, ozone tendency due to ozone transport and chemical ozone loss in the high\u2010latitude lower stratosphere before and after the SSW was analyzed for the period from 1 January 2010 to 11 February 2010. The evolution and distribution of ozone and HCl inside/outside the polar vortex associated with the vortex shift to the midlatitudes in January are quite similar between SMILES and MLS. Those of ClO are also similar, considering the difference in the local time for the measurement. Analyses of the nudged CCM run indicate that inside the polar vortex at 50\u2009hPa, the ozone concentration increased moderately owing to partial cancelation between the large negative ozone tendency due to chemical ozone destruction and large positive ozone tendency due to horizontal ozone influx from outside of the vortex as well as downward advection. In the region of a high ozone concentration with the same area as that of the polar vortex at 50\u2009hPa, the large increase in ozone was primarily due to a downward advection of ozone. SMILES and MLS observations, nudged CCM simulations, and ozone tendency analyses revealed a highly longitudinal dependent ozone tendency at high latitudes during the SSW."

        "abstract": "A minor sudden stratospheric warming with a major impact: Transport and polar processing in the 2014/2015 Arctic winter. Stratospheric transport and polar processing during the 2014/2015 Arctic winter were strongly influenced by a minor sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in early January. Disturbances to temperatures and trace gases in the middle and upper stratosphere were similar in character to those associated with major SSWs: The stratopause dropped, and vertical temperature gradients weakened, followed by renewed descent of mesospheric air. The lower stratospheric polar vortex was barely disrupted and remained unusually strong throughout the winter. The SSW did, however, cause lower stratospheric temperatures to rise well above chlorine activation thresholds; trace gas abundances from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) were consequently exceptional. The degree of chlorine activation in January was the smallest, and lower stratospheric ozone values in February were the highest, in the 11 year MLS record. The major role played by a minor SSW highlights the Arctic stratosphere's sensitivity to a spectrum of dynamical variability."

        "abstract": "Analysis of a rapid increase of stratospheric ozone during late austral summer 2008 over Kerguelen (49.4\u00b0 S, 70.3\u00b0 E). Abstract. This paper reports on an increase of ozone event observed over Kerguelen (49.4\u00b0 S, 70.3\u00b0 E) in relationship with large-scale isentropic transport. It is evidenced from ground-based observations, together with satellite global observations and assimilated fields.  The study is based on the analyses of the first ozonesonde experiment never recorded at the Kerguelen site in the framework of a French campaign called ROCK that took place from April to August 2008.  Comparisons and interpretations of the observed event are supported by co-localised SAOZ observations, by global mapping of tracers (O3, N2O and columns of O3) from Aura/MLS and Aura/OMI experiments, and by model simulations of Ertel Potential Vorticity initialised by ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) data reanalyses.  Satellite and ground-based observational data revealed a consistent increase of ozone in the local stratosphere by mid-April 2008. Additionally, Ozone (O3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) profiles obtained during January\u2013May 2008 by the Microwave Lamb Sounder (MLS) aboard the Aura satellite are assimilated into MOCAGE (MOd\u00e8le de Chimie Atmosph\u00e9rique \u00e0 Grande Echelle), a global three-dimensional chemistry transport model of M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France. The assimilated total O3 values are consistent with SAOZ ground observations (within \u00b15%), and isentropic distributions of O3 are matching well with maps of advected potential vorticity (APV) derived from the MIMOSA model, a high-resolution advection transport model, and from ECMWF reanalysis.  The studied event seems to be related to isentropic transport of air masses that took place simultaneously in the lower- and middle-stratosphere, respectively from the polar region and from tropics to the mid-latitudes.  In fact, the studied ozone increase by mid April 2008 results simultaneously: (1) from an equator-ward departure of polar air masses characterised with a high-ozone layer in the lower stratosphere (nearby the 475 K isentropic level), and (2) from a reverse isentropic transport from tropics to mid- and high-latitudes in the upper stratosphere (nearby the 700 K level). The increase of ozone observed over Kerguelen from the 16-April ozonesonde profile is then attributed to a concomitant isentropic transport of ozone in two stratospheric layers: the tropical air moving southward and reaches over Kerguelen in the upper stratosphere, and the polar air passing over the same area but in the lower stratosphere."

        "abstract": "An assessment of CALIOP polar stratospheric cloud composition classification. Abstract. This study assesses the robustness of the CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) composition classification algorithm \u2013 which is based solely on the spaceborne lidar data \u2013 through the use of nearly coincident gas-phase HNO3 and H2O data from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on Aura and Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) temperature analyses. Following the approach of Lambert et al. (2012), we compared the observed temperature-dependent HNO3 uptake by PSCs in the various CALIOP composition classes with modeled uptake for supercooled ternary solutions (STS) and equilibrium nitric acid trihydrate (NAT). We examined the CALIOP PSC data record from both polar regions over the period from 2006 through 2011 and over a range of potential temperature levels spanning the 15\u201330 km altitude range. We found that most PSCs identified as STS exhibit gas phase uptake of HNO3 consistent with theory, but with a small temperature bias, similar to Lambert et al. (2012). Ice PSC classification is also robust in the CALIOP optical data, with the mode in the ice observations occurring about 0.5 K below the frost point. We found that CALIOP PSCs identified as NAT mixtures exhibit two distinct preferred modes which reflect the fact that the growth of NAT particles is kinetically limited. One mode is significantly out of thermodynamic equilibrium with respect to NAT due to short exposure times to temperatures below the NAT existence temperature, TNAT, with HNO3 uptake dominated by the more numerous liquid droplets. The other NAT mixture mode is much closer to NAT thermodynamic equilibrium, indicating that the particles have been exposed to temperatures below TNAT for extended periods of time. With a few notable exceptions, PSCs in the various composition classes conform well to their expected temperature existence regimes. We have a good understanding of the cause of the minor misclassifications that do occur and will investigate means to correct these deficiencies in our next generation algorithm."

        "abstract": "A tropospheric chemistry reanalysis for the years 2005\u20132012 based on an assimilation of OMI, MLS, TES, and MOPITT satellite data. Abstract. We present the results from an 8-year tropospheric chemistry reanalysis for the period 2005\u20132012 obtained by assimilating multiple data sets from the OMI, MLS, TES, and MOPITT satellite instruments. The reanalysis calculation was conducted using a global chemical transport model and an ensemble Kalman filter technique that simultaneously optimises the chemical concentrations of various species and emissions of several precursors. The optimisation of both the concentration and the emission fields is an efficient method to correct the entire tropospheric profile and its year-to-year variations, and to adjust various tracers chemically linked to the species assimilated. Comparisons against independent aircraft, satellite, and ozonesonde observations demonstrate the quality of the analysed O3, NO2, and CO concentrations on regional and global scales and for both seasonal and year-to-year variations from the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere. The data assimilation statistics imply persistent reduction of model error and improved representation of emission variability, but they also show that discontinuities in the availability of the measurements lead to a degradation of the reanalysis. The decrease in the number of assimilated measurements increased the ozonesonde-minus-analysis difference after 2010 and caused spurious variations in the estimated emissions. The Northern/Southern Hemisphere OH ratio was modified considerably due to the multiple-species assimilation and became closer to an observational estimate, which played an important role in propagating observational information among various chemical fields and affected the emission estimates. The consistent concentration and emission products provide unique information on year-to-year variations in the atmospheric environment."

In particular, there is no comprehensive and quantitative study of the reaction rates and cycles averaged over the polar vortex under conditions of heterogeneous chemistry so far. We show time series of reaction rates averaged over the core of the polar vortex in winter and spring for all relevant reactions and indicate which reaction pathways and cycles are responsible for the vortex-averaged net change of the key species involved in ozone depletion, i.e., ozone, chlorine species (ClOx, HCl, ClONO2), bromine species, nitrogen species (HNO3, NOx) and hydrogen species (HOx). For clarity, we focus on one Arctic winter (2004\u20132005) and one Antarctic winter (2006) in a layer in the lower stratosphere around 54\u202fhPa and show results for additional pressure levels and winters in the Supplement. Mixing ratios and reaction rates are obtained from runs of the ATLAS Lagrangian chemistry and transport model (CTM) driven by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis data. An emphasis is put on the partitioning of the relevant chemical families (nitrogen, hydrogen, chlorine, bromine and odd oxygen) and activation and deactivation of chlorine."

        "abstract": "A Match-based approach to the estimation of polar stratospheric ozone loss using Aura Microwave Limb Sounder observations. Abstract. The well-established \"Match\" approach to quantifying chemical destruction of ozone in the polar lower stratosphere is applied to ozone observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on NASA's Aura spacecraft. Quantification of ozone loss requires distinguishing transport- and chemically induced changes in ozone abundance. This is accomplished in the Match approach by examining cases where trajectories indicate that the same air mass has been observed on multiple occasions. The method was pioneered using ozonesonde observations, for which hundreds of matched ozone observations per winter are typically available. The dense coverage of the MLS measurements, particularly at polar latitudes, allows matches to be made to thousands of observations each day. This study is enabled by recently developed MLS Lagrangian trajectory diagnostic (LTD) support products. Sensitivity studies indicate that the largest influence on the ozone loss estimates are the value of potential vorticity (PV) used to define the edge of the polar vortex (within which matched observations must lie) and the degree to which the PV of an air mass is allowed to vary between matched observations. Applying Match calculations to MLS observations of nitrous oxide, a long-lived tracer whose expected rate of change is negligible on the weekly to monthly timescales considered here, enables quantification of the impact of transport errors on the Match-based ozone loss estimates. Our loss estimates are generally in agreement with previous estimates for selected Arctic winters, though indicating smaller losses than many other studies. Arctic ozone losses are greatest during the 2010/11 winter, as seen in prior studies, with 2.0 ppmv (parts per million by volume) loss estimated at 450 K potential temperature (~ 18 km altitude). As expected, Antarctic winter ozone losses are consistently greater than those for the Arctic, with less interannual variability (e.g., ranging between 2.3 and 3.0 ppmv at 450 K). This study exemplifies the insights into atmospheric processes that can be obtained by applying the Match methodology to a densely sampled observation record such as that from Aura MLS."

        "abstract": "20 years of ClO measurements in the Antarctic lower stratosphere. Abstract. We present 20\u00a0years (1996\u20132015) of austral springtime measurements of chlorine monoxide (ClO) over Antarctica from the Chlorine Oxide Experiment (ChlOE1) ground-based millimeter wave spectrometer at Scott Base, Antarctica, as well 12\u00a0years (2004\u20132015) of ClO measurements from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). From August onwards we observe a strong increase in lower stratospheric ClO, with a peak column amount usually occurring in early September. From mid-September onwards we observe a strong decrease in ClO. In order to study interannual differences, we focus on a 3-week period from 28\u00a0August to 17\u00a0September for each year and compare the average column ClO anomalies. These column ClO anomalies are shown to be highly correlated with the average ozone mass deficit for September and October of each year. We also show that anomalies in column ClO are strongly anti-correlated with 30\u202fhPa temperature anomalies, both on a daily and an interannual timescale. Making use of this anti-correlation we calculate the linear dependence of the interannual variations in column ClO on interannual variations in temperature. By making use of this relationship, we can better estimate the underlying trend in the total chlorine (Cly\u202f\u2009=\u2009\u202fHCl\u202f+\u202fClONO2 + HOCl\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u202fCl2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u202fCl2O2 + ClO\u202f+\u202fCl). The resultant trends in Cly, which determine the long-term trend in ClO, are estimated to be \u22120.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2, \u22121.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.9, and \u22120.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.4\u202f%\u202fyear\u22121, for zonal MLS, Scott Base MLS (both 2004\u20132015), and ChlOE (1996\u20132015) respectively. These trends are within 1\u03c3 of trends in stratospheric Cly previously found at other latitudes. The decrease in ClO is consistent with the trend expected from regulations enacted under the Montreal Protocol."

We present observations defining (\n              i\n              ) the frequency and depth of convective penetration of water into the stratosphere over the United States in summer using the Next-Generation Radar system; (\n              ii\n              ) the altitude-dependent distribution of inorganic chlorine established in the same coordinate system as the radar observations; (\n              iii\n              ) the high resolution temperature structure in the stratosphere over the United States in summer that resolves spatial and structural variability, including the impact of gravity waves; and (\n              iv\n              ) the resulting amplification in the catalytic loss rates of ozone for the dominant halogen, hydrogen, and nitrogen catalytic cycles. The weather radar observations of \u223c2,000 storms, on average, each summer that reach the altitude of rapidly increasing available inorganic chlorine, coupled with observed temperatures, portend a risk of initiating rapid heterogeneous catalytic conversion of inorganic chlorine to free radical form on ubiquitous sulfate\u2212water aerosols; this, in turn, engages the element of risk associated with ozone loss in the stratosphere over the central United States in summer based upon the same reaction network that reduces stratospheric ozone over the Arctic. The summertime development of the upper-level anticyclonic flow over the United States, driven by the North American Monsoon, provides a means of retaining convectively injected water, thereby extending the time for catalytic ozone loss over the Great Plains. Trusted decadal forecasts of UV dosage over the United States in summer require understanding the response of this dynamical and photochemical system to increased forcing of the climate by increasing levels of CO\n              2\n              and CH\n              4\n              ."

This study introduces stratospheric and mesospheric hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) estimates from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) using an offline retrieval (i.e. run separately from the standard MLS algorithm). This new data set provides two daily zonal averages, one during daytime from 10 to 0.0032 hPa (using day-minus-night differences between 10 and 1 hPa to ameliorate systematic biases) and one during nighttime from 1 to 0.0032 hPa. The vertical resolution of this new data set varies from about 4 km at 10 hPa to around 14 km at 0.0032 hPa. A description of the methodology and an error analysis are presented. Comparisons against the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) and the Far Infrared Spectrometer (FIRS-2) measurements, as well as photochemical simulations, demonstrate the robustness of the retrieval and indicate that the retrieval is sensitive enough to detect mesospheric HO2 layers during both day and night. This new data set is the first long-term HO2 stratospheric and mesospheric satellite record and it provides needed constraints to help resolve the O3 deficit problem and the \"HOx dilemma\"."

        "abstract": "Signature of the 27-day solar rotation cycle in mesospheric OH and H <sub>2</sub> O observed by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder. Abstract. The mesospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) is mainly produced by the water vapor (H2O) photolysis and could be considered as a proxy for the influence of the solar irradiance variability on the mesosphere. We analyze the tropical mean response of the mesospheric OH and H2O data as observed by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) to 27-day solar variability. The analysis is performed for two time periods corresponding to the different phases of the 11-yr cycle: from December 2004 to December 2005 (the period of \"high activity\" with a pronounced 27-day solar cycle) and from August 2008 to August 2009 (\"solar minimum\" period with a vague 27-day solar cycle). We demonstrate, for the first time, that in the mesosphere the daily time series of OH concentrations correlate well with the solar irradiance (correlation coefficients up to 0.79) at zero time-lag. At the same time H2O anticorrelates (correlation coefficients up to \u22120.74) with the solar irradiance at non-zero time-lag. We found that the response of OH and H2O to the 27-day variability of the solar irradiance is strong for the period of the high solar activity and negligible for the solar minimum conditions. It allows us to suggest that the 27-day cycle in the solar irradiance and in OH and H2O are physically connected."

        "abstract": "Improved simulation of tropospheric ozone by a global-multi-regional two-way coupling model system. Abstract. Small-scale nonlinear chemical and physical processes over pollution source regions affect the tropospheric ozone (O3), but these processes are not captured by current global chemical transport models (CTMs) and chemistry\u2013climate models that are limited by coarse horizontal resolutions (100\u2013500 km, typically 200 km). These models tend to contain large (and mostly positive) tropospheric O3 biases in the Northern Hemisphere. Here we use the recently built two-way coupling system of the GEOS-Chem CTM to simulate the regional and global tropospheric O3 in 2009. The system couples the global model (at 2.5\u00b0\u00a0long.\u202f\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u202f2\u00b0\u00a0lat.) and its three nested models (at 0.667\u00b0\u00a0long.\u202f\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u202f0.5\u00b0\u00a0lat.) covering Asia, North America and Europe, respectively. Specifically, the nested models take lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) from the global model, better capture small-scale processes and feed back to modify the global model simulation within the nested domains, with a subsequent effect on their LBCs.  Compared to the global model alone, the two-way coupled system better simulates the tropospheric O3 both within and outside the nested domains, as found by evaluation against a suite of ground (1420\u00a0sites from the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG), the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratory Global Monitoring Division (GMD), the Chemical Coordination Centre of European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System (AQS)), aircraft (the High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER) Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) and Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapor by Airbus In- Service Aircraft (MOZAIC)) and satellite measurements (two Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) products). The two-way coupled simulation enhances the correlation in day-to-day variation of afternoon mean surface O3 with the ground measurements from 0.53 to 0.68, and it reduces the mean model bias from 10.8 to 6.7 ppb. Regionally, the coupled system reduces the bias by 4.6 ppb over Europe, 3.9 ppb over North America and 3.1 ppb over other regions. The two-way coupling brings O3 vertical profiles much closer to the HIPPO (for remote areas) and MOZAIC (for polluted regions) data, reducing the tropospheric (0\u20139 km) mean bias by 3\u201310 ppb at most MOZAIC sites and by 5.3 ppb for HIPPO profiles. The two-way coupled simulation also reduces the global tropospheric column ozone by 3.0 DU (9.5 %, annual mean), bringing them closer to the OMI data in all seasons. Additionally, the two-way coupled simulation also reduces the global tropospheric mean hydroxyl radical by 5 % with improved estimates of methyl chloroform and methane lifetimes. Simulation improvements are more significant in the Northern Hemisphere, and are mainly driven by improved representation of spatial inhomogeneity in chemistry/emissions.  Within the nested domains, the two-way coupled simulation reduces surface ozone biases relative to typical GEOS-Chem one-way nested simulations, due to much improved LBCs. The bias reduction is 1\u20137\u00a0times the bias reduction from the global to the one-way nested simulation. Improving model representations of small-scale processes is important for understanding the global and regional tropospheric chemistry."

        "abstract": "Probability density functions of long-lived tracer observations from satellite in the subtropical barrier region: data intercomparison. Abstract. Past studies have shown that a clear relationship exists between the field of a passive tracer and the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of tracer concentrations, which can be exploited to identify the position and variability of stratospheric barriers to isentropic mixing.  In the present study, we focus on the dynamical barrier located in the subtropics. We calculate PDFs of the long-lived tracers nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) from different satellite instruments: the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on board Aura, the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) on board Envisat, the Sub-Millimetre Radiometre (SMR) on board Odin and the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) on board UARS, overall covering the time period of 1992\u20132009.  An analysis of the consistency among the different sets of data and their capability of identifying mixing regions and barrier-to-transport regions in the stratosphere and the subtropical barrier location is a prime aim of the present study. This is done looking at the morphological structure of the one- and two-dimensional PDFs of tracer concentrations measured by the different instruments. The latter differ in their spatial and temporal sampling and resolution, and there are some systematic differences in the determination of the subtropical barrier position that have been highlighted. However, the four satellite instruments offer an overall consistent picture of the subtropical barrier annual cycle. There is a strong seasonality consistently represented, characterized by the wintertime shift of the subtropical edge toward the summer hemisphere. However, the influence of the Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO) on isentropic transport and mixing, and by consequence, on the position of the subtropical barrier, is not equally represented in all satellite data using the methodology proposed."

        "abstract": "Global OZone Chemistry And Related trace gas Data records for the Stratosphere (GOZCARDS): methodology and sample results with a focus on HCl, H<sub>2</sub>O, and O<sub>3</sub>. <p><strong>Abstract.</strong> We describe the publicly available data from the Global OZone Chemistry And Related trace gas Data records for the Stratosphere (GOZCARDS) project and provide some results, with a focus on hydrogen chloride (HCl), water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). This data set is a global long-term stratospheric Earth system data record, consisting of monthly zonal mean time series starting as early as 1979. The data records are based on high-quality measurements from several NASA satellite instruments and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on SCISAT. We examine consistency aspects between the various data sets. To merge ozone records, the time series are debiased relative to SAGE II (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiments) values by calculating average offsets versus SAGE II during measurement overlap periods, whereas for other species the merging derives from an averaging procedure during overlap periods. The GOZCARDS files contain mixing ratios on a common pressure\u2013latitude grid, as well as standard errors and other diagnostics; we also present estimates of systematic uncertainties in the merged products. Monthly mean temperatures for GOZCARDS were also produced, based directly on data from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications. <br><br> The GOZCARDS HCl merged product comes from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), ACE-FTS and lower-stratospheric Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data. After a rapid rise in upper-stratospheric HCl in the early 1990s, the rate of decrease in this region for 1997\u20132010 was between 0.4 and 0.7 % yr<sup>\u22121</sup>. On 6\u20138-year timescales, the rate of decrease peaked in 2004\u20132005 at about 1 % yr<sup>\u22121</sup>, and it has since levelled off, at ~ 0.5 % yr<sup>\u22121</sup>. With a delay of 6\u20137 years, these changes roughly follow total surface chlorine, whose behavior versus time arises from inhomogeneous changes in the source gases. Since the late 1990s, HCl decreases in the lower stratosphere have occurred with pronounced latitudinal variability at rates sometimes exceeding 1\u20132 % yr<sup>\u22121</sup>. Recent short-term tendencies of lower-stratospheric and column HCl vary substantially, with increases from 2005 to 2010 for northern midlatitudes and deep tropics, but decreases (increases) after 2011 at northern (southern) midlatitudes. <br><br> For H<sub>2</sub>O, the GOZCARDS product covers both stratosphere and mesosphere, and the same instruments as for HCl are used, along with Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) MLS stratospheric H<sub>2</sub>O data (1991\u20131993). We display seasonal to decadal-type variability in H<sub>2</sub>O from 22 years of data. In the upper mesosphere, the anticorrelation between H<sub>2</sub>O and solar flux is now clearly visible over two full solar cycles. Lower-stratospheric tropical H<sub>2</sub>O has exhibited two periods of increasing values, followed by fairly sharp drops (the well-documented 2000\u20132001 decrease and a recent drop in 2011\u20132013). Tropical decadal variability peaks just above the tropopause. Between 1991 and 2013, both in the tropics and on a near-global basis, H<sub>2</sub>O has decreased by ~ 5\u201310 % in the lower stratosphere, but about a 10 % increase is observed in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere. However, such tendencies may not represent longer-term trends. <br><br> For ozone, we used SAGE I, SAGE II, HALOE, UARS and Aura MLS, and ACE-FTS data to produce a merged record from late 1979 onward, using SAGE II as the primary reference. Unlike the 2 to 3 % increase in near-global column ozone after the late 1990s reported by some, GOZCARDS stratospheric column O<sub>3</sub> values do not show a recent upturn of more than 0.5 to 1 %; long-term interannual column ozone variations from GOZCARDS are generally in very good agreement with interannual changes in merged total column ozone (Version 8.6) data from SBUV instruments. <br><br> A brief mention is also made of other currently available, commonly formatted GOZCARDS satellite data records for stratospheric composition, namely those for N<sub>2</sub>O and HNO<sub>3</sub>.</p>"

        "abstract": "Are EEP Events Important for the Tertiary Ozone Maximum?. Energetic particle precipitation (EPP) increases the production of odd hydrogen (HOX ) species in the mesosphere, which catalytically destroy ozone (O3) in sunlight. Hence, the EPP\u2010HOX impact on the tertiary O3 maximum (TOM) depends on a complex geometry of a geographic\u2010oriented TOM, geomagnetic\u2010oriented auroral zone, producing short\u2010lived HOX species, and a destruction process depending on the solar zenith angle (SZA). Particle observations from the Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detectors telescopes aboard the Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites, and hydroxyl (OH) and O3 mixing ratios from Aura microwave limb sounder (MLS) are used to investigate the potential limitations of using the MLS observations to study EPP\u2010OH impact on the TOM in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results show limited overlap between the auroral zone and the TOM at twilight conditions. A composite analysis indicates O3 mixing ratio decrease over the auroral zone lagged by \u223c1 day compared to the maximum energetic electron precipitation (EEP)\u2010OH impact. Hence, MLS is predominantly observing a lagged and lower estimate of the response of O3 to EEP\u2010OH at SZA > 95\u00b0. The EEP impact region within the TOM is smaller than the overlap region, strongly modulated by the background atmospheric dynamics. The results, although limited by the satellites viewing conditions, imply that the importance of EEP upon O3 mixing ratio is strongly influenced by the background atmosphere, both in terms of chemistry and dynamics. Multisatellite observations at different solar local times are required to separate the direct from the lagged EEP\u2010OH impact on O3."

        "abstract": "Technical note: Reanalysis of Aura MLS chemical observations. Abstract. This paper presents a reanalysis of the atmospheric chemical composition from the upper troposphere to the lower mesosphere from August\u00a02004 to December\u00a02017. This reanalysis is produced by the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObsErvations (BASCOE) constrained by the chemical observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on board the Aura satellite. BASCOE is based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) method and includes a chemical transport model driven by the winds and temperature from the ERA-Interim meteorological reanalysis. The model resolution is 3.75\u2218 in longitude, 2.5\u2218 in latitude and 37 vertical levels from the surface to 0.1\u2009hPa with 25 levels above 100\u2009hPa. The outputs are provided every 6\u2009h. This reanalysis is called BRAM2 for BASCOE Reanalysis of Aura MLS, version 2. Vertical profiles of eight species from MLS version 4 are assimilated and are evaluated in this paper: ozone (O3), water vapour (H2O), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric acid (HNO3), hydrogen chloride (HCl), chlorine oxide (ClO), methyl chloride (CH3Cl) and carbon monoxide (CO). They are evaluated using independent observations from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS), the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) and N2O observations from a different MLS radiometer than the one used to deliver the standard product and ozonesondes. The evaluation is carried out in four regions of interest where only selected species are evaluated. These regions are (1)\u00a0the lower-stratospheric polar vortex where O3, H2O, N2O, HNO3, HCl and ClO are evaluated; (2)\u00a0the upper-stratospheric\u2013lower-mesospheric polar vortex where H2O, N2O, HNO3 and CO are evaluated; (3)\u00a0the upper troposphere\u2013lower stratosphere (UTLS) where O3, H2O, CO and CH3Cl are evaluated; and (4)\u00a0the middle stratosphere where O3, H2O, N2O, HNO3, HCl, ClO and CH3Cl are evaluated. In general BRAM2 reproduces MLS observations within their uncertainties and agrees well with independent observations, with several limitations discussed in this paper (see the summary in Sect.\u00a05.5). In particular, ozone is not assimilated at altitudes above (i.e. pressures lower than) 4\u2009hPa due to a model bias that cannot be corrected by the assimilation. MLS ozone profiles display unphysical oscillations in the tropical UTLS, which are corrected by the assimilation, allowing a good agreement with ozonesondes. Moreover, in the upper troposphere, comparison of BRAM2 with MLS and independent observations suggests a positive bias in MLS O3 and a negative bias in MLS H2O. The reanalysis also reveals a drift in MLS N2O against independent observations, which highlights the potential use of BRAM2 to estimate biases between instruments. BRAM2 is publicly available and will be extended to assimilate MLS observations after 2017."

This paper describes new total stratospheric inorganic\nbromine (Br y ) abundance estimates inferred from the first\nglobal observations of upper stratospheric BrO, made by the\nEOS Microwave Limb Sounder on the Aura satellite. Our\n\u2018best estimate\u2019 of total upper stratospheric bromine loading\n(based on JPL-2002 kinetics with the addition of a BrONO 2 +\nO reaction) is 18.6 \u00b1 5.5 pptv, for the period September\n2004 to August 2005, from 55\u00b0 S to 55\u00b0 N. This implies a\ncontribution of 3.0 \u00b1 5.5 pptv from sources other than long\nlived CH 3 Br and halons. The possibility of such other\nsources has been raised by balloon, aircraft and satellite\nobservations of BrO in the lower and middle stratosphere.\nThese upper stratospheric observations provide new\ninformation to help resolve the current uncertainty in\nstratospheric bromine loading. The abundance of bromine,\nparticularly in the lower stratosphere, is a significant factor\nin the budget of stratospheric O 3 ."

We have analyzed near-global stratospheric data (and mesospheric data as well\nfor H2O) in terms of absolute abundances, variability, and trends for\nO3, H2O, HCl, N2O, and HNO3, based on Aura\nMicrowave Limb Sounder (MLS) data, as well as longer-term series from the\nGlobal OZone Chemistry And Related trace gas Data records for the\nStratosphere (GOZCARDS). While we emphasize the evaluation of stratospheric\nmodels via data comparisons through 2014 to free-running (FR-WACCM) and\nspecified dynamics (SD-WACCM) versions of the Community Earth System Model\nversion 1 (CESM1) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), we also\nhighlight observed stratospheric changes, using the most recent data from\nMLS. Regarding highlights from the satellite data, we have used multiple linear\nregression to derive trends based on zonal mean time series from Aura MLS\ndata alone, between 60\u2218\u2009S and 60\u2218\u2009N. In the upper\nstratosphere, MLS O3 shows increases over 2005\u20132018 at \u223c0.1\u20130.3\u2009%\u2009yr\u22121 (depending on altitude and latitude) with 2\u03c3 errors of\n\u223c0.2\u2009%\u2009yr\u22121. For the lower stratosphere (LS), GOZCARDS O3\ndata for 1998\u20132014 point to small decreases between 60\u2218\u2009S and\n60\u2218\u2009N, but the trends are more positive if the starting year is\n2005. Southern midlatitudes (30\u201360\u2218\u2009S) exhibit\nnear-zero or slightly positive LS trends for 1998\u20132018. The LS O3 trends\nbased on 2005\u20132018 MLS data are most positive (0.1\u20130.2\u2009%\u2009yr\u22121) at these\nsouthern midlatitudes, although marginally statistically significant, in\ncontrast to slightly negative or near-zero trends for 2005\u20132014. Given the high\nvariability in LS O3, and the high sensitivity of trends to the choice\nof years used, especially for short periods, further studies are required for\na robust longer-term LS trend result. For H2O, upper-stratospheric\nand mesospheric trends from GOZCARDS 1992\u20132010 data are near zero (within\n\u223c0.2\u2009%\u2009yr\u22121) and significantly smaller than trends (within\n\u223c0.4\u20130.7\u2009%\u2009yr\u22121) from MLS for 2005\u20132014 or 2005\u20132018. The\nlatter short-term positive H2O trends are larger than expected from\nchanges resulting from long-term increases in methane. We note that the very\nshallow solar flux maximum of solar cycle 24 has contributed to fairly large\nshort-term mesospheric and upper-stratospheric H2O trends since 2005.\nHowever, given known drifts in the MLS H2O time series, MLS\nH2O trend results, especially after 2010, should be viewed as upper\nlimits. The MLS data also show regions and periods of small HCl increases in\nthe lower stratosphere, within the context of the longer-term stratospheric\ndecrease in HCl, as well as interhemispheric\u2013latitudinal differences in\nshort-term HCl tendencies. We observe similarities in such short-term\ntendencies, and interhemispheric asymmetries therein, for lower-stratospheric\nHCl and HNO3, while N2O trend profiles exhibit anti-correlated\npatterns. In terms of the model evaluation, climatological averages for 2005\u20132014 from\nboth FR-WACCM and SD-WACCM for O3, H2O, HCl, N2O, and\nHNO3 compare favorably with Aura MLS data averages over this period.\nHowever, the models at mid- to high latitudes overestimate mean MLS LS\nO3 values and seasonal amplitudes by as much as 50\u2009%\u201360\u2009%;\nsuch differences appear to implicate, in part, a transport-related model\nissue. At lower-stratospheric high southern latitudes, variations in polar\nwinter and spring composition observed by MLS are well matched by SD-WACCM, with the main\nexception being for the early winter rate of decrease in HCl, which is too\nslow in the model. In general, we find that the latitude\u2013pressure\ndistributions of annual and semiannual oscillation amplitudes derived from\nMLS data are properly captured by the model amplitudes. In terms of closeness\nof fit diagnostics for model\u2013data anomaly series, not surprisingly, SD-WACCM\n(driven by realistic dynamics) generally matches the observations better than\nFR-WACCM does. We also use root mean square variability as a more valuable\nmetric to evaluate model\u2013data differences. We find, most notably, that\nFR-WACCM underestimates observed interannual variability for H2O;\nthis has implications for the time period needed to detect small trends,\nbased on model predictions. The WACCM O3 trends generally agree (within 2\u03c3 uncertainties)\nwith the MLS data trends, although LS trends are typically not statistically\ndifferent from zero. The MLS O3 trend dependence on latitude and\npressure is matched quite well by the SD-WACCM results. For H2O, MLS\nand SD-WACCM positive trends agree fairly well, but FR-WACCM shows\nsignificantly smaller increases; this discrepancy for FR-WACCM is even more\npronounced for longer-term GOZCARDS H2O records. The larger\ndiscrepancies for FR-WACCM likely arise from its poorer correlations with\ncold point temperatures and with quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) variability. For HCl, while some\nexpected decreases in the global LS are seen in the observations, there are\ninterhemispheric differences in the trends, and increasing tendencies are\nsuggested in tropical MLS data at 68\u2009hPa, where there is only a slight\npositive trend in SD-WACCM. Although the vertical gradients in MLS HCl trends\nare well duplicated by SD-WACCM, the model trends are always somewhat more\nnegative; this deserves further investigation. The original MLS N2O\nproduct time series yield small positive LS tropical trends (2005\u20132012),\nconsistent with models and with rates of increase in tropospheric N2O.\nHowever, longer-term series from the more current MLS N2O standard\nproduct are affected by instrument-related drifts that have also impacted MLS\nH2O. The LS short-term trend profiles from MLS N2O and\nHNO3 at midlatitudes in the two hemispheres have different signs;\nthese patterns are well matched by SD-WACCM trends for these species. These model\u2013data comparisons provide a reminder that the QBO and other\ndynamical factors affect decadal variability in a major way, notably in the\nlower stratosphere, and can thus significantly hinder the goals of robustly\nextracting (and explaining) small underlying long-term trends. The data sets\nand tools discussed here for model evaluation could be expanded to\ncomparisons of species or regions not included here, as well as to\ncomparisons between a variety of chemistry\u2013climate models."

Abstract. This Technical Note presents a statistical approach to evaluating simultaneous\nmeasurements of several atmospheric components under the assumption of\nphotochemical equilibrium. We consider simultaneous measurements of OH,\nHO2, and O3 at the altitudes of the mesosphere as a specific\nexample and their daytime photochemical equilibrium as an evaluating\nrelationship. A simplified algebraic equation relating local concentrations\nof these components in the 50\u2013100\u2009km altitude range has been derived. The\nparameters of the equation are temperature, neutral density, local zenith\nangle, and the rates of eight reactions. We have performed a one-year simulation\nof the mesosphere and lower thermosphere using a 3-D chemical-transport model.\nThe simulation shows that the discrepancy between the calculated evolution of\nthe components and the equilibrium value given by the equation does not\nexceed 3\u20134\u2009% in the full range of altitudes independent of season or\nlatitude. We have developed a statistical Bayesian evaluation technique for\nsimultaneous measurements of OH, HO2, and O3 based on the\nequilibrium equation taking into account the measurement\nerror.\nThe first results of the application of the technique to\nMLS/Aura data (Microwave Limb Sounder) are presented in\nthis Technical Note. It has been found that the satellite data of the HO2\ndistribution regularly demonstrate lower altitudes of this\ncomponent's mesospheric maximum.\nThis has also been confirmed by model\nHO2 distributions and comparison with offline retrieval of HO2 from\nthe daily zonal means MLS radiance."

        "abstract": "The major stratospheric final warming in 2016: dispersal of vortex air and termination of Arctic chemical ozone loss. Abstract. The 2015/16 Northern Hemisphere winter stratosphere appeared to have the greatest potential yet seen for record Arctic ozone loss. Temperatures in the Arctic lower stratosphere were at record lows from December 2015 through early February 2016, with an unprecedented period of temperatures below ice polar stratospheric cloud thresholds. Trace gas measurements from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) show that exceptional denitrification and dehydration, as well as extensive chlorine activation, occurred throughout the polar vortex. Ozone decreases in 2015/16 began earlier and proceeded more rapidly than those in 2010/11, a winter that saw unprecedented Arctic ozone loss. However, on 5\u20136\u00a0March 2016 a major final sudden stratospheric warming (\"major final warming\", MFW) began. By mid-March, the mid-stratospheric vortex split after being displaced far off the pole. The resulting offspring vortices decayed rapidly preceding the full breakdown of the vortex by early April. In the lower stratosphere, the period of temperatures low enough for chlorine activation ended nearly a month earlier than that in 2011 because of the MFW. Ozone loss rates were thus kept in check because there was less sunlight during the cold period. Although the winter mean volume of air in which chemical ozone loss could occur was as large as that in 2010/11, observed ozone values did not drop to the persistently low values reached in 2011.We use MLS trace gas measurements, as well as mixing and polar vortex diagnostics based on meteorological fields, to show how the timing and intensity of the MFW and its impact on transport and mixing halted chemical ozone loss. Our detailed characterization of the polar vortex breakdown includes investigations of individual offspring vortices and the origins and fate of air within them. Comparisons of mixing diagnostics with lower-stratospheric N2O and middle-stratospheric CO from MLS (long-lived tracers) show rapid vortex erosion and extensive mixing during and immediately after the split in mid-March; however, air in the resulting offspring vortices remained isolated until they disappeared. Although the offspring vortices in the lower stratosphere survived longer than those in the middle stratosphere, the rapid temperature increase and dispersal of chemically processed air caused active chlorine to quickly disappear. Furthermore, ozone-depleted air from the lower-stratospheric vortex core was rapidly mixed with ozone rich air from the vortex edge and midlatitudes during the split. The impact of the 2016 MFW on polar processing was the latest in a series of unexpected events that highlight the diversity of potential consequences of sudden warming events for Arctic ozone loss."

        "abstract": "Unusual chlorine partitioning in the 2015/16 Arctic winter lowermost stratosphere: observations and simulations. Abstract. The Arctic winter 2015/16 was characterized by cold stratospheric temperatures. Here we present a comprehensive view of the temporal evolution of chlorine in the lowermost stratosphere over the course of the studied winter. We utilize two-dimensional vertical cross sections of ozone (O3) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2), measured by the airborne limb imager GLORIA (Gimballed Limb Observer for Radiance Imaging of the Atmosphere) during the POLSTRACC/GW-LCYCLE\u00a0II/GWEX/SALSA campaigns, to investigate the tropopause region in detail. Observations from three long-distance flights in January, February, and March\u00a02016 are discussed. ClONO2 volume mixing ratios up to 1100\u2009pptv were measured at 380\u2009K potential temperature in mesoscale structures. Similar mesoscale structures are also visible in O3 measurements. Both trace gas measurements are applied to evaluate simulation results from the chemistry transport model CLaMS (Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere) and the chemistry\u2013climate model EMAC (ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry). These comparisons show agreement within the expected performance of these models.\nSatellite measurements from Aura/MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) and SCISAT/ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment \u2013 Fourier Transform Spectrometer) provide an overview over the whole winter and information about the stratospheric situation above the flight altitude. Time series of these satellite measurements reveal unusually low hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ClONO2 at 380\u2009K from the beginning of January to the end of February\u00a02016, while chlorine monoxide (ClO) is strongly enhanced. In March\u00a02016, unusually rapid chlorine deactivation into HCl is observed instead of deactivation into ClONO2, the more typical pathway for deactivation in the Arctic. Chlorine deactivation observed in the satellite time series is well reproduced by CLaMS. Sensitivity simulations with CLaMS demonstrate the influence of low abundances of O3 and reactive nitrogen (NOy) due to ozone depletion and sedimentation of NOy-containing particles, respectively. On the basis of the different altitude and time ranges of these effects, we conclude that the substantial chlorine deactivation into HCl at 380\u2009K arose as a result of very low ozone abundances together with low temperatures. Additionally, CLaMS estimates ozone depletion of at least 0.4\u2009ppmv at 380\u2009K and 1.75\u2009ppmv at 490\u2009K, which is comparable to other extremely cold Arctic winters.\nWe have used CLaMS trajectories to analyze the history of enhanced ClONO2 measured by GLORIA. In February, most of the enhanced ClONO2 is traced back to chlorine deactivation that had occurred within the past few days prior to the GLORIA measurement. In March, after the final warming, air masses in which chlorine has previously been deactivated into ClONO2 have been transported in the remnants of the polar vortex towards the location of measurement for at least\u00a011\u2009d."

Constituent evolution for\u00a01990\u20132015 simulated using the Global Modeling Initiative chemistry and transport model driven by meteorological fields from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version\u00a02\u00a0(MERRA-2) is compared with three sources of observations: ground-based column measurements of HNO3 and HCl from two stations in the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC, \u223c\u20091990\u2013ongoing), profiles of CH4 from the Halogen Occultation Experiment\u00a0(HALOE) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS, 1992\u20132005), and profiles of N2O from the Microwave Limb Sounder on the Earth Observing System satellite Aura (2005\u2013ongoing). The differences between observed and simulated values are shown to be time dependent, with better agreement after \u223c\u20092000 compared with the prior decade. Furthermore, the differences between observed and simulated HNO3 and HCl columns are shown to be correlated with each other, suggesting that issues with the simulated transport and mixing cause the differences during the\u00a01990s and that these issues are less important during the later years. Because the simulated fields are related to mean age in the lower stratosphere, we use these comparisons to evaluate the time dependence of mean age. The ongoing NDACC column observations provide critical information necessary to substantiate trends in mean age obtained using fields from MERRA-2 or any other reanalysis products."

        "abstract": "Northern Hemisphere atmospheric influence of the solar proton events and ground level enhancement in January 2005. Abstract. Solar eruptions in early 2005 led to a substantial barrage of charged particles on the Earth's atmosphere during the 16\u201321 January period. Proton fluxes were greatly increased during these several days and led to the production of HOx (H, OH, HO2) and NOx (N, NO, NO2), which then caused the destruction of ozone. We focus on the Northern polar region, where satellite measurements and simulations with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM3) showed large enhancements in mesospheric HOx and NOx constituents, and associated ozone reductions, due to these solar proton events (SPEs). The WACCM3 simulations show enhanced short-lived OH and HO2 concentrations throughout the mesosphere in the 60\u201382.5\u00b0 N latitude band due to the SPEs for most days in the 16\u201321 January 2005 period, somewhat higher in abundance than those observed by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). These HOx enhancements led to huge predicted and MLS-measured ozone decreases of greater than 40 % throughout most of the northern polar mesosphere during the SPE period. Envisat Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) measurements of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) show increases throughout the stratosphere with highest enhancements of about 60 pptv in the lowermost mesosphere over the 16\u201318 January 2005 period due to the solar protons. WACCM3 predictions indicate H2O2 enhancements over the same time period of about three times that amount. Measurements of nitric acid (HNO3) by both MLS and MIPAS show an increase of about 1 ppbv above background levels in the upper stratosphere during 16\u201329 January 2005. WACCM3 simulations show only minuscule HNO3 increases (<0.05 ppbv) in the upper stratosphere during this time period. Polar mesospheric enhancements of NOx are computed to be greater than 50 ppbv during the SPE period due to the small loss rates during winter. Computed NOx increases, which were statistically significant at the 95 % level, lasted about a month past the SPEs. The SCISAT-1 Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer NOx measurements and MIPAS NO2 measurements for the polar Northern Hemisphere are in reasonable agreement with these predictions. An extremely large ground level enhancement (GLE) occurred during the SPE period on 20 January 2005. We find that protons of energies 300 to 20 000 MeV, associated with this GLE, led to very small enhanced lower stratospheric odd nitrogen concentrations of less than 0.1 % and ozone decreases of less than 0.01 %."

This version is based on the algorithm described by Livesey et al. (2006a) but uses a more realistic atmospheric state to constrain the retrieval. A description of the methodology and an error analysis are presented. Single daily profile precision uncertainty, when taking the ascending-descending (day-night) difference, was found to be up to 40 pptv while systematic error biases were estimated to be less than about 3 pptv. Monthly mean comparisons show broad agreement with other measurements as well as with state-of-the-art numerical models. We infer a 2005 yearly total inorganic Br<sub>y</sub> using the measured MLS BrO to be 20.3 &amp;plusmn; 4.5 pptv, which implies a contribution from very short lived substances to the stratospheric bromine budget of 5 &amp;plusmn; 4.5 pptv.</p>"

        "abstract": "Impact of January 2005 solar proton events on chlorine species. Abstract. Sudden changes in stratospheric chlorine species in the polar northern atmosphere, caused by the Solar Proton Events (SPEs) of 17 and 20 January 2005, have been investigated and compared with version 4 of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM4). We used Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) measurements to monitor the variability of ClO, HCl, HOCl and Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounder (MIPAS) on ENVISAT to retrieve ClONO2. SPE-induced chlorine activation has been identified. HCl decrease occurred at nearly all the investigated altitudes (i.e., 10\u20130.5 hPa) with the strongest decrease (of about 0.25 ppbv) on 21 January. HOCl was found to be the main active chlorine species under nighttime conditions (with increases of more than 0.2 ppbv) whereas both HOCl and ClO enhancements (about 0.1 ppbv) have been observed at the polar night terminator. Further, small ClO decreases (of less than 0.1 ppbv) and ClONO2 enhancements (about 0.2 ppbv) have been observed at higher latitudes (i.e., at nighttime) roughly above 2 hPa.  While WACCM4 reproduces most of the SPE-induced variability in the chlorine species fairly well, in some particular regions discrepancies between the modeled and measured temporal evolution of the abundances of chlorine species were found. HOCl changes are modelled very well with respect to both magnitude and geographic distribution. ClO decreases are reproduced at high latitudes, whereas ClO enhancements in the terminator region are underestimated and attributed to background variations. WACCM4 also reproduces the HCl depletion in the mesosphere but it does not show the observed decrease below about 2 hPa. Finally, WACCM4 simulations indicate that the observed ClONO2 increase is dominated by background variability, although SPE-induced production might contribute by 0.1 ppbv."

        "abstract": "The uptake of HO2 on meteoric smoke analogues. The kinetics of heterogeneous HO2 uptake onto meteoric smoke particles (MSPs) has been studied in the laboratory using analogues of MSP aerosol entrained into a flow tube. The uptake coefficient, \u03b3, was determined on synthetic amorphous olivine (MgFeSiO4) to be (6.9 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10\u22122 at a relative humidity (RH) of 10%. On forsterite (Mg2SiO4), \u03b3 = (4.3 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22123 at RH = 11.6% and (7.3 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22122 at RH = 9.9% on fayalite (Fe2SiO4). These results indicate that Fe plays a more important mechanistic role than Mg in the removal of HO2 from the gas phase. Electronic structure calculations show that Fe atoms exposed at the particle surface provide a catalytic site where HO2 is converted to H2O2 via an Eley-Rideal mechanism, but this does not occur on exposed surface Mg atoms. The impact of this heterogeneous process in the middle atmosphere was then investigated using a whole atmosphere chemistry-climate model which incorporates a microphysical treatment of MSPs. Using a global MSP production rate from meteoric ablation of 44 t/day, heterogeneous uptake (with \u03b3 = 0.2) on MSPs significantly alters the HOx budget in the nighttime polar vortex. This impact is highly latitude dependent and thus could not be confirmed using currently available satellite measurements of HO2, which are largely unavailable at latitudes greater than 70\u00b0."

        "abstract": "Diurnal variation of stratospheric and lower mesospheric HOCl, ClO and HO <sub>2</sub> at the equator: comparison of 1-D model calculations with measurements by satellite instruments. Abstract. The diurnal variation of HOCl and the related species ClO, HO2 and HCl measured by satellites has been compared with the results of a one-dimensional photochemical model. The study compares the data from various limb-viewing instruments with model simulations from the middle stratosphere to the lower mesosphere. Data from three sub-millimetre instruments and two infrared spectrometers are used, namely from the Sub-Millimetre Radiometer (SMR) on board Odin, the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on board Aura, the Superconducting Submillimeter-wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) on the International Space Station, the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) on board ENVISAT, and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on board SCISAT. Inter-comparison of the measurements from instruments on sun-synchronous satellites (SMR, MLS, MIPAS) and measurements from solar occultation instruments (ACE-FTS) is challenging since the measurements correspond to different solar zenith angles (or local times). However, using a model which covers all solar zenith angles and data from the SMILES instrument which measured at all local times over a period of several months provides the possibility to verify the model and to indirectly compare the diurnally variable species. The satellite data were averaged for latitudes of 20\u00b0 S to 20\u00b0 N for the SMILES observation period from November 2009 to April 2010 and were compared at three altitudes: 35, 45 and 55 km. Besides presenting the SMILES data, the study also shows a first comparison of the latest MLS data (version 3.3) of HOCl, ClO, and HO2 with other satellite observations, as well as a first evaluation of HO2 observations made by Odin/SMR. The MISU-1D model has been carefully initialised and run for conditions and locations of the observations. The diurnal cycle features for the species investigated here are generally well reproduced by the model. The satellite observations and the model agree well in terms of absolute mixing ratios. The differences between the day and night values of the model are in good agreement with the observations although the amplitude of the HO2 diurnal variation is 10\u201320% lower in the model than in the observations. In particular, the data offered the opportunity to study the reaction ClO+HO2 \u2192 HOCl+O2 in the lower mesosphere at 55 km. At this altitude the HOCl night-time variation depends only on this reaction. The result of this analysis points towards a value of the rate constant within the range of the JPL 2006 recommendation and the upper uncertainty limit of the JPL 2011 recommendation at 55 km."

        "abstract": "Chlorine partitioning near the polar vortex edge observed with ground-based FTIR and satellites at Syowa Station, Antarctica, in 2007 and 2011. Abstract. We retrieved lower stratospheric vertical profiles of O3, HNO3,\nand HCl from solar spectra taken with a ground-based Fourier transform\ninfrared spectrometer (FTIR) installed at Syowa Station, Antarctica\n(69.0\u2218\u2009S, 39.6\u2218\u2009E), from March to December\u00a02007 and\nSeptember to November\u00a02011. This was the first continuous measurement of\nchlorine species throughout the ozone hole period from the ground in\nAntarctica. We analyzed temporal variation of these species combined with\nClO, HCl, and HNO3 data taken with the Aura MLS (Microwave Limb\nSounder) satellite sensor and ClONO2 data taken with the Envisat MIPAS\n(the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) satellite\nsensor at 18 and 22\u2009km over Syowa Station. An HCl and ClONO2 decrease\noccurred from the end of May at both 18 and 22\u2009km, and eventually, in early winter, both HCl and ClONO2 were almost depleted. When the sun returned\nto Antarctica in spring, enhancement of ClO and gradual O3 destruction\nwere observed. During the ClO-enhanced period, a negative correlation between\nClO and ClONO2 was observed in the time series of the data at Syowa\nStation. This negative correlation was associated with the relative distance\nbetween Syowa Station and the edge of the polar vortex. We used MIROC3.2\nchemistry\u2013climate model (CCM) results to investigate the behavior of whole\nchlorine and related species inside the polar vortex and the boundary region\nin more detail. From CCM model results, the rapid conversion of chlorine\nreservoir species (HCl and ClONO2) into Cl2, gradual conversion of\nCl2 into Cl2O2, increase in HOCl in the winter period, increase in ClO when sunlight became available, and conversion of ClO into HCl were successfully reproduced. The HCl decrease in the winter polar vortex core\ncontinued to occur due to both transport of ClONO2 from the subpolar\nregion to higher latitudes, providing a flux of ClONO2 from more sunlit\nlatitudes into the polar vortex, and the heterogeneous reaction of HCl with\nHOCl. The temporal variation of chlorine species over Syowa Station was affected\nby both heterogeneous chemistries related to polar stratospheric cloud (PSC)\noccurrence inside the polar vortex and transport of a NOx-rich air mass\nfrom the polar vortex boundary region, which can produce additional\nClONO2 by reaction of ClO with NO2. The deactivation pathways from\nactive chlorine into reservoir species (HCl and/or ClONO2) were\nconfirmed to be highly dependent on the availability of ambient O3. At\n18\u2009km, where most ozone was depleted, most ClO was converted to HCl. At 22\u2009km\nwhere some O3 was available, an additional increase in ClONO2 from\nthe prewinter value occurred, similar to the Arctic."

        "abstract": "Evaluation of the ACCESS \u2013 chemistry\u2013climate model for the Southern Hemisphere. Abstract. Chemistry\u2013climate models are important tools for addressing interactions of composition and climate in the Earth system. In particular, they are used to assess the combined roles of greenhouse gases and ozone in Southern Hemisphere climate and weather. Here we present an evaluation of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator \u2013 chemistry\u2013climate model (ACCESS-CCM), focusing on the Southern Hemisphere and the Australian region. This model is used for the Australian contribution to the international Chemistry\u2013Climate Model Initiative, which is soliciting hindcast, future projection and sensitivity simulations. The model simulates global total column ozone (TCO) distributions accurately, with a slight delay in the onset and recovery of springtime Antarctic ozone depletion, and consistently higher ozone values. However, October-averaged Antarctic TCO from 1960 to 2010 shows a similar amount of depletion compared to observations. Comparison with model precursors shows large improvements in the representation of the Southern Hemisphere stratosphere, especially in TCO concentrations. A significant innovation is seen in the evaluation of simulated vertical profiles of ozone and temperature with ozonesonde data from Australia, New Zealand and Antarctica from 38 to 90\u00b0 S. Excess ozone concentrations (greater than 26 % at Davis and the South Pole during winter) and stratospheric cold biases (up to 10 K at the South Pole during summer and autumn) outside the period of perturbed springtime ozone depletion are seen during all seasons compared to ozonesondes. A disparity in the vertical location of ozone depletion is seen: centred around 100 hPa in ozonesonde data compared to above 50\u202fhPa in the model. Analysis of vertical chlorine monoxide profiles indicates that colder Antarctic stratospheric temperatures (possibly due to reduced mid-latitude heat flux) are artificially enhancing polar stratospheric cloud formation at high altitudes. The model's inability to explicitly simulate a supercooled ternary solution may also explain the lack of depletion at lower altitudes. Analysis of the simulated Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index compares well with ERA-Interim data, an important metric for correct representation of Australian climate. Accompanying these modulations of the SAM, 50 hPa zonal wind differences between 2001\u20132010 and 1979\u20131998 show increasing zonal wind strength southward of 60\u00b0 S during December for both the model simulations and ERA-Interim data. These model diagnostics show that the model reasonably captures the stratospheric ozone-driven chemistry\u2013climate interactions important for Australian climate and weather while highlighting areas for future model development."

        "abstract": "Microwave Limb Sounder observations of biomass-burning products from the Australian bush fires of February 2009. Abstract. The large bush fires which occurred in southeast Australia in February 2009 were unusually destructive. However, they were also unusual in the amounts of various combustion products which were injected directly into the stratosphere. We report the observations by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on the Aura satellite of some of these combustion products. The highest quality observations are of CO; these clearly show a large region of enhanced mixing ratios to the north of New Zealand which remains in that region for about ten days before drifting westwards and finally dissipating over the Atlantic about a month after the fire. The region of enhanced CO ascends from the tropopause to 46 hPa during this period. Back trajectories run from the points where MLS observes enhanced CO pass close to the site of the fire. The MLS observations of CH3CN and HCN resemble those of CO except for their poorer vertical resolution and more limited vertical range. An apparent enhancement in ClO is also observed by MLS, but detailed analysis of the measured radiances reveals this feature to be a signature of CH3OH, which is not currently retrieved by the MLS data processing system. The fires of February 2009 are the only event of this type and magnitude in the 7-yr MLS record."
